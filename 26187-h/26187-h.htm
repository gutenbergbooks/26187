<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Girls</span>, come to order!&#8221; shouted Hilda
Bretherton in a somewhat disorderly
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we come to order without
a president?&#8221; queried a rosy-cheeked, roly-poly
damsel answering to the name of
Puddy Kennett.</p>

<p>&#8220;I elect Prue Shaftsbury!&#8221; screamed
Hilda above the merry din of voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't elect&mdash;you simply nominate,&#8221;
said Prue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I second the motion,&#8221; said Nannie
Branscome, and her remark was instantly
followed by a storm of &#8220;ayes&#8221; before
they were called for, and the president
was declared elected and proceeded to
take her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies,&#8221; said she, &#8220;we are met
to consider a scandalous&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scurrilous,&#8221; suggested Hilda.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;alarming article,&#8221; continued the
president, &#8220;entitled 'How to Cook
Wives.'&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! here!&#8221; interrupted Hilda again,
&#8220;we can't do anything until we've elected
officers and appointed committees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of a club of four members?&#8221;
queried Prudence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Mother said that yesterday
at her club, out of eight women they
elected twelve officers and appointed
seven committees of three each. Why,
you know two men can't meet on a street
corner without immediately forming a
secret society, electing president, vice-president,
secretary, and treasurer, and
appointing a committee of five to get up
a banquet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But to return to the subject,&#8221; persisted
the president&mdash;a long-faced girl
with a solemn countenance, but a suspicious
gleam in her eye. &#8220;'How to
Cook Wives'&mdash;that is the question before
the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;'How to Cook Wives!' Well, if that
isn't rich! It makes me think of the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
English nursery song&mdash;'Come, ducky,
come and be killed.' Now it will be,
'Come, ducky, come and be cooked.' I
move that Congress be urged to enact a
law adopting that phrase as the only legal
form of proposal. Then if any little
goose accepts she knows what to expect,
and is not caught up and fried without
foreknowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies,&#8221; said the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't mow me down in my prime,&#8221;
urged Hilda in an injured tone. &#8220;I'm
making my maiden speech in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, girls, look, quick!&#8221; cried Puddy.
&#8220;See Miss Leigh. Isn't that a fetching
gown she has on?&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire club rushed to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who's she with?&#8221; asked Hilda. &#8220;He's
rather fetching, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe his name is Chance,&#8221; said
Puddy Kennett. &#8220;He's not a society fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he's the chum of that lovely man,&#8221;
said Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which lovely man?&#8221; asked Prue.
&#8220;There are so many of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;oh, you know his name. I
can't think of it&mdash;Loveland&mdash;Steve Loveland.
We met him at Constance Leigh's
one evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Nannie Branscome colored, but
no one noticed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies, come to order,&#8221; said
the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or order will come to you,&#8221; said
Hilda. &#8220;Prue has raised her parasol&mdash;gavel,
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes Amy Frisbe,&#8221; remarked
Puddy from her post by the window.
&#8220;Do you know her engagement's off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I'll be jig&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Hilda began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; said the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;The president objects to slang, but I'll
still be jiggered, as Lord Fauntleroy's
friend remarked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; said the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls, that reminds me,&#8221; said Puddy.
&#8220;I met a publisher from New York at the
opera last night who objected to the
slightest slang.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, me!&#8221; exclaimed Hilda. &#8220;Why,
where has Mother Nature been keeping
the dear man all these years?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On Mr. Sheldon's editorial staff,&#8221;
suggested Nannie Branscome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that's too bad, Nannie,&#8221; exclaimed
Prudence. &#8220;My father&mdash;and he's
not a religious man&mdash;said the Topeka
<i>Capital</i> was a wonderful paper Sheldon's
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not denying that,&#8221; said Nannie.
&#8220;I believe it was wonderful. I believe
and tremble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With other little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; said the president, and Hilda
subsided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Amy Frisbe at the opera last
night?&#8221; asked Puddy rather irrelevantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hilda, &#8220;but Arthur Driscol
was. He sat in a box with the Gorman
party and was devoted to Mamie Moore
all the evening. If I'd been Mrs. Gorman
I'd dropped him over the railing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't mean that Amy Frisbe has
been jilted?&#8221; exclaimed the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, and it's her third serious heart
wound. Really, that girl is entitled to
draw a pension.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I'll be jig&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Nannie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; said the president, and then
she added: &#8220;Young ladies, it is for you
to decide how you'll be served up in future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Is</i> it for us to decide?&#8221; asked Nannie
Branscome.</p>

<p>She had a peculiar way of saying things
of this sort. She would lower her head
and look out from under her head frizzles
in a non-committal fashion, but with a
suggestion of something that made her
piquant, bewitching face irresistible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the president. &#8220;The
style of cooking depends on the cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let us first see what choice we
have in the matter. What variety of
dishes are named? Where's the article
and where did it come from?&#8221; asked
Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;George Daly had it last night and he
read bits of it between the acts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that's what I missed by declining
Mrs. Warren's box party invitation!&#8221; exclaimed
Hilda. &#8220;Well, let's have the
article.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven't got it,&#8221; said Puddy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
&#8220;George wouldn't give it to me. He
said it belonged to Mr. Porter, but I
copied some of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there's Evelyn Rogers. Let's
call her in. Evelyn! Evelyn!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda was at the window gesticulating
and calling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies,&#8221; said the president,
&#8220;I'm surprised. Come to order. Good-morning,
Evelyn. We are met to consider
an important matter&mdash;'How to Cook
Wives.'&#8221;</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all you called me in for? I
heard enough of that last night. It was
George Daly's theme all the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you at the box party?&#8221; asked
Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was so silly as to go. Oh,
these society people just wear me out.
I'm more tired this morning than I should
be if I'd worked at a churn all day yesterday.
They're so stupid. They talk
all night about nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to commend them for intellectual
economy; they make a little go
such a long way,&#8221; said Prudence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Seriously, though, are you met to consider
that piece?&#8221; asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Puddy. &#8220;We just happened
to meet, and that came up for discussion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as I don't care&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began
Evelyn, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; said the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;The publisher from New York says
slang is not used in the best circles,&#8221; said
Hilda.</p>

<p>She recited this in a loud, stereotyped
tone, giving the last word a strong upward
inflection, suggestive of a final call
to the dining-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Evelyn. &#8220;I met
him at the box party last night, and he
told me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; inquired Puddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said it must be awful to be deaf
from birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he hear that?&#8221; laughed Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume he did, for he gave me one
look and straightway became dumb as
well as deaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls, I must be going!&#8221; exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Hilda suddenly. &#8220;Really, if any poor
galley slave works harder than I do, I
commend him to the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Adults. I've already
been out to a luncheon to-day, at
Mrs. Pierce's, and Pachmann's <i>matin&eacute;e</i>
this afternoon, and I must go to Joe
Harding's dinner to-night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to that swell affair?&#8221;
interrupted Puddy. &#8220;I envy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't,&#8221; said Evelyn scornfully. &#8220;Joe
Harding's little better than an idiot, and
he's notorious in many ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can give swell dinners, though,
and the best people are his guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they're not,&#8221; said Evelyn emphatically.
&#8220;I'm not there and never will
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies, come to order,&#8221; said
Hilda in a severe tone, &#8220;and listen to my
tale of woe. After the Harding dinner
I go to the opera with the Harding party,
and then, with my chaperone, that pink of
propriety, Mrs. Warren, I attend the
Pachmann reception at the Rutherfords.
Now, if your scrubwoman can name a
longer, harder, or&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More soul and brain enervating list,&#8221;
continued Evelyn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be pleased&mdash;I mean pained
to hear it,&#8221; concluded Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what does it all amount to?&#8221;
asked Evelyn. &#8220;Will any one tell me
what you are working for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A settlement,&#8221; said Nannie promptly.
&#8220;I'm the only niece of poor but impecunious
relatives, and they expect me to
do my best and marry well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness, child!&#8221; exclaimed Hilda,
&#8220;I hope you don't tell the brutal, cold-blooded
truth in society!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, that isn't it,&#8221; said Puddy.
&#8220;We are going out to have a good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you slaves and bondwomen!&#8221; exclaimed
Evelyn. &#8220;You don't know what
a good time means. I must be off.
Adieu, seneschals.&#8221; And with a pitying
smile she left them.</p>

<p>She was a handsome, spirited-looking
girl, with a queenly carriage. As she
went out of the house Constance Leigh
came by, and the two walked off together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There's a pair of them,&#8221; Hilda remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awfully nice girls,&#8221; said Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, but they're rabid. Constance
Leigh is as independent as a March hare,
and Evelyn is perfectly fierce for reforms
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, a socialist?&#8221; asked Prudence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not exactly, but she gathers the
most awful class of people about her, and
fairly bristles with indignation if one ventures
to criticise them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean&mdash;criminals?&#8221;
asked Prudence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You'd think so if you chanced to run
into one of them. Why, last Sunday
evening she had an inebriate up to tea
with her; next Sunday she expects a wife-beater,
or choker, or something of that
sort, and the other day, when I was coming
out from a call on her, I met a black-browed,
desperately wicked-looking man&mdash;as
big as a mountain. I know he was
a murderer or something. I never was
so frightened in my life. Why, I took
to my heels and ran the length of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
street. I presume he was after me, but I
didn't dare look behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn't have worried, Hilda,&#8221;
said Prudence. &#8220;You know big men
never run after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a notorious fact that most of
Hilda's admirers were about half her size.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. That holds good in society,
but I don't know what might obtain in
criminal circles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hilda, did your villain carry a cane
and wear glasses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was too frightened to notice, but I
believe he flourished a stout stick of some
sort, and I do remember a wicked gleam
about his eyes&mdash;might have been spectacles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it's Professor Thing-a-my-Bob,
or Dry-as-Dust, or somebody or other,
from Washington. He's her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don't care if he is,&#8221; persisted
Hilda. &#8220;He's a wicked-looking villain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; screamed the girls, and then
Prudence added, with mock solemnity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Any one who could talk slightingly of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a genuine college professor would speak
disrespectfully of the equator or be sassy
to the dictionary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'd just enjoy telling the poor old
proff what Hilda&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Nannie,
but the persevering president interrupted
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies, you will now come to
order and consider the subject in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which hand? Or in other words,
where's that article? I should like to see
it,&#8221; said Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;It appeared in the <i>Tribune</i>, but I
didn't see it,&#8221; said Puddy, &#8220;but I can give
you some little bits, here and there, that
I jotted down as George Daly read them.
Now listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Order,&#8221; said the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;'First catch your fish,'&#8221; Puddy read
impressively, looking around for approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;First go a-fishing, I should say,&#8221; said
Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;'Don't hang up your fish on a hook
in the housekeeper's department and think
your work is done.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's Hugh Millett,&#8221; murmured the
president. &#8220;I don't think he's been home
since he returned from his wedding trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;'Start with a clear fire, not too hot.
Don't pile on all the wood and coal at
once, for if the fire burns down before
your fish is done it will be quite spoiled.'&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Munsey is a spoiled fish,
then,&#8221; said Hilda. &#8220;Don't you remember,
Prue, how Will Munsey heaped on
the lovering at first? It was four inches
deep&mdash;lovey this and dovey that till it
fairly cloyed one. But the fire went out
long ago. There's no spark or sparking
on that hearth now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;'Don't think, after the cooking is well
under way, that you can leave it to take
care of itself.' I had something more,&#8221;
said Puddy, fumbling in her reticule for
another bit of paper. &#8220;Oh, here it is:
'Don't stuff your fish with dried crusts
composed of the way your mother used to
do this.' And here's another: 'Some
husbands, after making it so hot in private
that their poor wives are nearly reduced
to a cinder, serve them up in public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
with a cold shoulder. Others toss
them carelessly into a kettle to simmer
from morning till night over the nursery
fire.'&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going,&#8221; said Nannie abruptly, and
without further ceremony she departed,
just as Evelyn Rogers came in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie Branscome is a perfect&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Hilda began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; said the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I trust she'll settle in a heavily
wooded country, for the cooking she'll
require before she's palatable would break
a millionaire if fuel was dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! she'll do well enough when she
has her growth,&#8221; said Prudence in her
dry way.</p>

<p>Nannie's growth was a subject of jest
among her mates. At sixteen she suddenly
thrust her foot forward into womanhood
with saucy bravado, as it
seemed. At seventeen she snatched it
back&mdash;pettishly, some said, but there were
those who looked deeper, and they discerned
a certain vague terror in the movement&mdash;a
dread of the unknown. Since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that time&mdash;almost a year now&mdash;Nannie
had been hovering on the border line,
something like a ghost that has ceased to
be an inhabitant of this world and yet
refuses to be well laid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen to this, girls,&#8221; said Puddy,
who was intent on reading her excerpts
to the bitter end. &#8220;'If a wife is allowed
to boil at all, <i>she always boils over</i>.'&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would require a high temperature
to boil you, Hilda,&#8221; said Prudence with a
laugh, for Hilda's good-nature had passed
into proverb.</p>

<p>The girl looked down from her five
feet nine inches of height with her easy,
comfortable smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Because of my altitude?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;'And you will be sure to scald your
fingers and get the worst of it,'&#8221; Puddy
went on relentlessly.</p>

<p>This struck Evelyn's fancy and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls, I can just see Nannie's husband
sitting in the doorway of their cabin
blowing his fingers and wincing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you?&#8221; said a voice, and the girls
started as they saw Nannie standing between
the curtains of the folding doors.</p>

<p>Sometimes she resembled an elf in her
weird beauty; just now she looked more
like an imp.</p>

<p>Something disagreeable might have ensued,
for Nannie's temper was uncertain
and undisciplined, but Prudence said in a
presidential tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies, it is for you to decide
how you will be served up in future. Will
some one please make a motion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let's decide how each other will
be served,&#8221; said Hilda. &#8220;You know at
church nobody applies any of the sermon
to himself, but fits it all on to his neighbors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evelyn will be raked over the coals,&#8221;
said Nannie in a low, intense voice.</p>

<p>Evelyn's handsome face flushed and
her lips parted for a retort, but Hilda exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Puddy will be made into delicious
round croquets,&#8221; and she smacked her lips
with anticipatory relish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hilda'll be kept in a nice continual
stew,&#8221; retorted Puddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie'll be parboiled, fried, fricasseed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
began Hilda, but Nannie exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I'll be roasted&mdash;you see if I'm
not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prue will be baked in a genteel, modern
way,&#8221; said Evelyn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; shouted Hilda, to get above the
noise. &#8220;Girls, mark my words. Some
day Mr. Smith, Brown, or Jones, whoever
he is, will invite us all to a clambake,
and when we arrive we'll find it's just
dear old Prue served up.&#8221;</p>

<p>This hit at Prudence's usual silence
struck the company forcibly, and after a
little more from the recipe they broke up
with noisy mirth.</p>

<p>On the doorstep Nannie paused and
looked about her. Puddy's last extract
from the article under discussion was
wandering through her brain, something
as a cat wanders through a strange house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Order a dressing as rich and as plentiful
as you can afford.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie understood this well enough.
She was wearing such a dressing at that
very moment, but the next sentence
puzzled her.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can't afford the best, heap your
fish with crumbs of comfort. Press
some of these into pretty shapes, such as
hearts, and roses, and true lovers' knots.
If you have neither the patience nor the
skill to follow these directions, take my
advice and don't go a-fishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie had never received a caress at
home in her life and very few abroad, for
she was not one to form close friendships
among the girls. Her parents had died
before she could become acquainted with
them, and the aunt who had reared her
was a worldly woman who looked upon
her merely as a valuable piece of social
property. Nannie's lack of popularity
was disappointing, but the aunt still hoped
that her unusual beauty would atone for
her brusqueness, crudity, and lack of tact,
and she would form a rich alliance. Between
her aunt and uncle there had never
been, to Nannie's knowledge, the slightest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
expression of affection, and so when
one spoke of &#8220;hearts and roses&#8221; and &#8220;true
lovers' knots&#8221; in a domestic connection,
the words fell strangely upon the girl's
ears.</p>

<p>The sun was streaming through the
trees that lined the broad, handsome avenue
as the merry group broke up. Happy
children, their dear little bodies tastefully
clothed and their dear little faces wreathed
in smiles, flitted about here and there at
play, like pretty elves. Now and then
some one or more of them would run,
with shouts of glee, to welcome a home-coming
father.</p>

<p>In the heart of a more womanly, more
happily trained girl, all this would have
awakened tender yearnings. It awakened
a feeling in Nannie's heart&mdash;just
what it meant she could not have told&mdash;but
this vague, unused something was
soon swept one side by a more comical
image. As she looked at the handsome
dwellings she seemed to hear a voice calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wives for dinner! wives for dinner!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And from the household altars there
rose the smoke of unique dishes&mdash;domestic
fries, feminine roasts, conjugal stews,
in highly colored family jars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, ducky, come and be cooked!&#8221;
sounded in her ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I thank you,&#8221; said Nannie audibly.</p>

<p>And she hurried down the avenue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening a few weeks previous to
the formation of the Young Woman's
Club&mdash;for an infant society of that name
dated from the burlesque meeting just
described&mdash;Randolph Chance was seated
in the room of his nearest friend and was
talking over the events of the day. Ordinarily
he was not free of speech, but with
this man he could think aloud. There
are folk whose very presence is enough
to shut one up with a snap as the wrong
touch closes the shell of a clam; there are
others who act upon us as heaven's own
sun and dew act upon the flowers.</p>

<p>For a time after Randolph had taken
his accustomed seat&mdash;an old chair in an
ingle-nook of the fireplace&mdash;he was silent,
possibly through physical disability, for
there was no elevator at night, and nine
flights of stairs is not provocative of conversation;
or he may have been awed into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
silence, for he often told Steve that he
was nearer heaven than he would ever be
again in all probability. Be that as it may,
he sat there enjoying his thoughts and
the restful atmosphere of the room. Quite
unlike a bachelor's apartment, this; as
unlike as many another belonging to that
particular branch of the <i>genus homo</i>&mdash;rooms
in which we would probably receive
a mild shock and be compelled to
rebuild our entire structure of theories
on the subject of the helplessness, uncomfortableness,
and general miserableness
of that specimen known as bachelor.
To be sure, Steve Loveland was fortunate
in the selection of his rookery, but
that might be called an outcome of his
genius&mdash;a genius with which bachelors
are not supposed to be blessed. At first
glance, one who had no such gift for
situation would not have considered such
a spot favorable for the construction of a
home&mdash;if this word may, for a moment,
be snatched from the wedded portion of
the human race&mdash;but the artist in Steve
recognized its possibilities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Carnot Fonnac, who originally reared
and owned the building under discussion,
was himself a wretched, reprehensible
bachelor, but being also a Frenchman he
possessed some taste; and intending to
make his abode in the sky-parlor of his
structure, he so planned it that there was
a hint of grace and beauty in its arches
and dimensions, as well as of expanse.
An English friend suggested the fireplace,
and he had the good sense to act
upon this most sensible advice. After
Fonnac's death his building went into retirement,
so to speak; fashion minced off
in another direction and left it to its grief,
so now, at the remove of some fifteen
years, Steve Loveland obtained the rental
of the attic for a mere song, and here he
cast his lot, for he was his own housekeeper.
A few screens skillfully arranged
reduced the apparent size of the apartment;
some old-fashioned furniture his
mother spared him made it homelike and
comfortable; an air-tight stove on the one
side (there were two chimneys) held
Boreas at bay, while on the other a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
basket grate of coals, setting like a ruddy
gem in the center of the ample fireplace,
was at once an element of good cheer and
a respecter of the law of economy.</p>

<p>On this particular evening the cronies
sat in their accustomed places within the
fireplace, one on either side; a little stand,
on which were set a couple of plates of
crackers and cheese, stood near by, and a
pot of oysters, cheerily simmering, hung
from the crane above the fire.</p>

<p>Randolph was silent; so was Steve&mdash;the
latter never talked; in place of words
he used the poker&mdash;not in any fiendish
way; heaven forbid! but in a mild, unobtrusive
manner, intelligible only to himself
and Randolph. In this system of
fireworks stenography, so to speak, a
series of slow, deliberate pokes under the
fire implied contemplation; poking down
from above stood for disagreement; while
thrusts of the poker between the ribs of
the grate expressed sympathy or agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; said Randolph&mdash;his chair was
tilted against the brick side wall of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
chimney, and he was leaning back, with
his hands clasped behind his head&mdash;&#8220;I
tell you she's a pretty nice girl; an awfully
sensible girl; one of the kind that
sets your brain to jogging. It's easy to
talk to her, she's so suggestive, wide
awake, and at the same time she's restful,
too. She's none of your hoity-toity characters,
one thing one day and another the
next, so you never know where you stand
with them. You can feel secure with
her. I feel as if I had known her all my
life; there's the most perfect understanding
between us; we don't have to talk; I
think she knows my thoughts, and I'm
certain I know hers. Awfully nice girl;
one of the nicest I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be,&#8221; said Steve gently.</p>

<p>After this there was some talk of a
desultory sort, some solicitous watching
of the oysters that were singing softly
preparatory to boiling, and then Randolph
bethought him of a conversation
he overheard on the train that day and
repeated it to Loveland, who sat bending
over toward the fire, his elbows resting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
on his knees and poker in hand ready for
action.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, Steve, it sets one thinking
to get at the woman's side of the matter,&#8221;
said Randolph. &#8220;I've been idiot enough
to suppose they thought just as we do on
most subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveland smiled and poked the fire
gently from above.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know we've always been taught
that women were naturally dependent,
and I supposed it was second nature for
them to receive money from their husbands,
and so they got enough they cared
no more about it. Do you think many of
them feel like that woman in the car?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveland poked the fire from beneath
and then sighed helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can't say, I'm sure,&#8221; he replied in his
gentle, hesitant way. &#8220;They don't seem
to go according to tradition in anything,
so far as I've noticed. They're a peculiar
race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don't know about that,&#8221; said
Randolph in a practical tone. &#8220;It's pretty
easy to understand, once your attention's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
called to it. I'd never given the subject
any thought, but if one chooses to observe
he can very soon find out what's
what. Some men are idiots and won't
learn, so they get in a mess.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's natural for you to be mystified,
Steve,&#8221; continued Randolph after a short
pause, &#8220;but you see I have a sister and I
know all about women. You can judge
of the rest by any one of them. They're
pretty much alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveland gave the top of the fire a few
little jabs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Randolph. &#8220;You
have mother and sister both, but you
haven't lived with them for years. If
you don't actually live in the same house
with women you can't know them. Of
course even then you may be in the dark
on a point or two, as I was on the money
question, but you can soon learn. All a
woman wants is fair treatment. If a
man drinks and makes a beast of himself
or sulks around in place of telling her
what he don't like and letting her change
it, of course she isn't going to be happy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
It's easy as rolling off a log to manage a
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveland rose and thrust the poker
down through the top crust of the fire and
left it standing there.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as management goes,&#8221; Randolph
went on unheedingly, &#8220;leaving
morality, and expense, and all that out of
the question, I'd just as soon turn Mormon
and marry forty women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Loveland stabbed the fire clear
through the body, bringing the poker out
on the under side and against the hearth
with a force that bent its glowing point.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stew's done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We'll
dish up now.&#8221;</p>

<p>This little scene, or rather the conversation
that seasoned the stew, soon faded
from Randolph's memory, but it lingered
in the mind of his companion. Men like
the latter, little given to speech, are apt to
turn and re-turn in thought what has been
said to them, and therefore do not easily
forget.</p>

<p>Several weeks after this the two men
sat on the bachelor hearth once more;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Loveland in his usual quiet mood and
Chance smarting from a recent wound.
He had begun to feel that his position
was almost secure with Miss Leigh, but
that day, on the occasion of a picnic at
which he had amused himself by trifling
with a silly young girl, he was amazed,
mortified, and hurt by receiving the cold
shoulder when he proffered his company
to Miss Leigh on the way home.</p>

<p>His friend's hospitable hearth had more
than once proven a refuge and a solace.
It was so to-night, and Randolph began
to take heart again as he settled back in
his comfortable chair in the ingle-nook
and watched the hanging of the oyster
stew upon the crane.</p>

<p>For a time the gentle simmering of the
appetizing dish was the only sound to be
heard. Randolph did not feel like talking
or even listening, and his companion
knew how to hold his peace.</p>

<p>Steve Loveland was one of those men
whose intuitive sense is as fine as a woman's;
of delicate physique, strong brain,
and a sensitive temperament that might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
have gone off on a morbid tangent
but for the common sense, cheerfulness,
and unselfishness that held it true to
the course. The last man in the world to
lead a lonely life, but there was an invalid
mother and a delicate sister in a
pretty little country town home some two
hundred miles away, and that was why
Steve had no home of his own. Loving
nature as I think most men of fine, sensitive
fiber do, yearning for wife, and
children, and hearthstone, as every good
man must, he had cheerfully and forever
put one side all hope of fulfilling these
holy dreams and had taken his place on
the force of a daily paper, never thinking
he was a hero. His comrades never
thought of that, either; they only knew
that he was always pleasant, always considerate,
always every inch a man, and
they loved him with one accord.</p>

<p>It was to such a friend as this that
Randolph had given his heart, for although
he did not fully understand him,
he loved him, and the answering affection
he received was one of the most beautiful
of tributes to his own fine qualities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>When Randolph was ready to talk he
told the story of the day&mdash;its hope, its
disappointment, and humiliation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It beats the Dutch, Steve. I can't
think what was the matter. There wasn't
a thing I did or a word I said to make her
behave so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve was softly poking the fire from
above. The night was quite cool for
June.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there was not,&#8221; Randolph reaffirmed.
&#8220;I've gone over the whole day
again and again. I didn't give her the
least excuse. What do you suppose was
the matter with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve looked up with an almost startled
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I'm sure I can't say. They're
quite beyond me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They're beyond every one,&#8221; said Randolph
in the tone of a Supreme Court
judge. &#8220;I don't see what the Lord made
them for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve looked up again and there was
the least suspicion of a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it,&#8221; he asked in his gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
way&mdash;&#8220;how many of them is it you are
prepared to manage?&#8221;</p>

<p>Randolph brought his chair down on its
four legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a confounded one!&#8221; he said.</p>



<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a time Randolph Chance was fairly
dazed by the suddenness with which his
fortune changed. Yesterday it was down&mdash;deep
down; to-day it had gone flying
up. He had followed Constance Leigh
when she walked to the lake in the afternoon;
had helped her from a perilous
place in the midst of rough winds and
still rougher waves; and as he took her
from the pier their eyes had met, and
this was why, later on, he sat by his
friend's fireside in a state of bewildered
rapture.</p>

<p>An outsider, one of the world's common
folk, would have made but little out
of Randolph's brief, rough-hewn sentences.
But Loveland was finely strung;
he understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't forget that look. It breaks
me all up every time I think of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Randolph spoke like a man who was
talking to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's so unreal&mdash;I may have dreamed
it,&#8221; he went on slowly. &#8220;I tell you,
Steve&#8221;&mdash;this with a sudden turn&mdash;&#8220;I
don't dare to hope, but if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no perceptible tremor in his
voice, but the sentence broke sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, old man, I know,&#8221; said Steve
in his gentlest voice.</p>

<p>And he poked the fire softly between
the ribs of the grate.</p>

<p>It seemed that Randolph's hope was not
without foundation, for after he had been
the toy of fate somewhat longer he came
to Steve one night with great news, and
yet no news to Steve, who had long discerned
the signs of the times and had
been dreading what he saw must come.
Now, although he felt sharp pangs of
grief on seeing his boon and sole companion
snatched from him and about to
be offered up upon the altar matrimonial,
yet he rejoiced thereat with the full force
of his unselfish nature.</p>

<p>On this especial night the two men sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
beside the fire, and also beside some of the
last oysters that would ever be served up
with the spicy sauce of this same good
comradeship. As befitted so memorable
an occasion, the oysters were big fellows
and were frying gloriously.</p>

<p>Randolph, who was in great good
spirits, leaned over and lifted them carefully
with a fork he held in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Things
are done brown now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the two men looked up at each
other and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>There was one important ceremony
which Randolph felt must precede the
marriage service, and that was the introduction
of his bosom friend to his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've been puzzling my brains to think
how I can bring this about,&#8221; he said to
Constance one day. &#8220;I've already hinted
at it to Steve, but he don't take. I know
he wants to meet you, but he's such a retiring
fellow&mdash;not really bashful, but like
a clam in his shell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't distress yourself, I beg of you,&#8221;
said Constance with a mischievous smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
&#8220;Mr. Loveland and I have already met
and are now the best of friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randolph stared at her in open-mouthed
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; he managed to ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here in this parlor. I must tell
you about it&mdash;it was most beautiful. His
card took me by surprise, but I supposed
you had brought him. When I came
downstairs there he was, looking altogether
different from your descriptions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like that!&#8221; said Randolph.
&#8220;Do you mean to impeach my statements?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Altogether better,&#8221; persisted Constance.
&#8220;Yes, he is taller and has a
most interesting face. He came forward
to greet me without a particle of embarrassment,
and there was something so
manly and simple, and withal so high-bred
in his every movement, that I was
charmed. I know he must come of a fine
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he does. He had a line of ancestors
a mile long aboard the <i>Mayflower</i>.
A cousin of his was telling me. He never
said a word. He never talks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Constance with an arch
smile. &#8220;He talked that evening, I assure
you, and to good effect. He had but a
few moments to stay, but he made every
moment tell. For one thing, he assured
me, with a most winning smile, that he
should feel constrained to rise in church
and forbid the banns unless I promised to
adopt him as a brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randolph's eyes and mouth opened
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you'd better adopt him as
something still nearer!&#8221; he said, with a
pretense of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you mention it,&#8221; Constance
replied in a confidential tone, &#8220;I came
very near doing so. The only reason I
did not was that he forgot to ask me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randolph broke into a laugh. Then
he added in a puzzled tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it beats everything! In all the
ten years I've known him I've never
heard him say as much as that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't repeat all he said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Constance
began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; Randolph cried with another
semblance of jealousy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;No, because it lay in his manner; that
gentle, affectionate, yet manly manner&mdash;indescribable!
perfectly indescribable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's the same to everybody,&#8221; said
Randolph, &#8220;and everybody loves him. I
never knew another such fellow. It's
past belief the way he wins people. And
he says nothing, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but he does!&#8221; repeated Constance.
&#8220;Well, well, there's no telling it all. I
continually think of the word delightful
in recurring to it and him. I assured
him that he would be a member of our
family, and that our fireside and our crust&mdash;I
really didn't dare to promise more
than a crust, you know, Randolph&mdash;would
be his as well as ours. When he
left he said good-by in the same perfectly
easy, natural way, calling me Constance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Randolph exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then he said, 'I am a brother
now, you know,' and he bent and kissed
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dickens!&#8221; cried Randolph.</p>

<p>And Constance finished the sentence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;He did. And really in the most delightful
way,&#8221; she added na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>Shortly after this cementing of new
bonds there was a quiet wedding ceremony
one morning at the little suburban
church, and when this was over Randolph
and Constance were ready for their
walk through life.</p>

<p>This walk&mdash;sometimes quickened into
a jog trot and even into a lope, sometimes
slackened till it becomes a crawl&mdash;is
variously diversified, according to the
temper and general disposition of the parties.
In the present instance there was
reasonable hope of some harmony of gait,
but life is life, whether within or without
the wedded fold, and &#8220;human natur' is
human natur';&#8221; and although David
Harum may tell us that some folks have
more of this commodity than others, yet
we know that every one has a lump of
it, at least, and usually, thank God! a
lump of leaven as well.</p>

<p>The first agitating question upon marriage
is that of residence. Happily Randolph
and Constance were agreed upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this point. Both were indifferent to the
city; both were lovers of the country.
Randolph had once read a certain sweet
pastoral termed &#8220;Liberty and a Living,&#8221;
and hardly a day had passed since the
reading that he had not recalled it and
speculated as to how he could adjust it to
his own life.</p>

<p>The fact that the writer, like himself,
was a journalist; that he broke loose from
just such shackles as were wearing Randolph's
pleasure in life, made it seem
more possible to the latter, and now that
he had joined hands with a woman of similar
tastes, the experiment seemed really
feasible.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's easy enough if we'll only think
so,&#8221; said Randolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>looks</i> easy,&#8221; Constance replied more
cautiously; &#8220;that's one reason why I am
afraid of it. That proves to me that we
don't know anything about it. If it were
really so easy more people would try it.
We're not the only ones who love the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder more people don't try it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8221;
Randolph exclaimed. &#8220;When I look
around me in the train and see the care-worn,
harassed faces the men wear, I
wonder they don't break loose from their
drudgery and go to living. What's the
use of existing if you have to drudge
continually for your bread, and must eat
even that in debt half the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We</i> may have to do without bread,&#8221;
said Constance, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we'll eat cake, as Marie Antoinette
suggested,&#8221; Randolph responded
promptly.</p>

<p>There really was some practical preparation
for the proposed country life, although
many of the plans seemed visionary
enough. Randolph had long been
considering an offer from a local magazine
that would enable him to do most
of his work at home, but the pay was
smaller and less certain than he could
wish. However, he at last decided to resign
from the newspaper force with which
he had for years been connected and to
risk taking the other position.</p>

<p>Now, happily, he had done good, faithful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
work in his present place and was
highly esteemed. Consequently, as soon
as the editor of the paper learned why he
was going and what he wanted, he offered
him the editorship of the literary
department in the Saturday issue, at a
smaller salary than he had been receiving,
to be sure, but still a larger and more
certain one than he could earn on the
magazine, and this he accepted and went
on his way with much rejoicing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll only have to go into the city once
a week now,&#8221; he said to Constance, &#8220;and
my literary work at home won't require
over three hours a day. That's something
like living!&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance was as delighted as he, but
she was more cautious and said less. She
once remarked in this connection that she
intended to borrow a motto from Steve's
coat of arms&mdash;&#8220;Mum's the Word.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the past few years Randolph's
expenses had been small and his earnings
considerable; consequently he had quite
a goodly sum in bank. With a portion
of this he and Constance bought a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
place in the country, happening on a genuine
bargain, as one will if he has cash in
hand. The house was little more than a
cabin, and they decided to devote it to
their servants&mdash;a married pair&mdash;while
they built a cottage for their own use.</p>

<p>The latter deserves more than a passing
word. Both Randolph and Constance
had &#8220;Liberty and a Living&#8221; in mind when
they planned it, and although it did not
precisely repeat that charming little domicile,
yet it was built in much the same
style. The one big room&mdash;library, dining-room,
and sometime kitchen combined&mdash;looked
out from three sides. In
the early morning it saw the clouds piled
up in expectant glory over the way across
the surging lake; toward evening its windows
to the left blazed their farewell as
day sailed into the west; while golden
sunbeams played at hide-and-go-seek
among its pretty furnishings throughout
the midway hours. Even on cold, cloudy
days there was still good cheer, for a big
log fire crackled on the ample hearth beneath
the oaken mantel, whereon a glowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
iron had etched Cowper's invitation
(who could say it nay?):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nor stir the fire and close the shutters fast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let fall the curtains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheel the sofa round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throws up a steamy column, and the cups<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cheer, but not inebriate, wait on each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let us welcome cheerful evening in.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The very furnishings of this library
were intellectually and spiritually appetizing.
A large desk, off one side, bespoke
brain work; a solid center-table, strewn
with books and magazines, made one long
for the glow of the big lamp and the leisure
of the evening, while Constance's
grand piano seemed to stir the very air
with a dream of harmony. The room
was lined with low book-cases; above
Shakespeare stood his bust; above the
many volumes on musical themes, busts
of Beethoven and Wagner; pictures&mdash;not
costly paintings, but engravings, photo-gravures,
and etchings, scenes from other
lands, sweet spiritual faces, suggestions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of great lives&mdash;looked down from the
walls; while over all, as a frieze to the
oaken room, ran the words: &#8220;'Tis love
that makes the world go round.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Steve Loveland this home seemed
more like Paradise than mortal abode.
He watched its building and making with
as intense an interest as Randolph's and
with far more of sentiment. Marriage
to him meant Elysium&mdash;the inexpressible,
the unattainable; more so than ever now.
But whatever yearnings the sweet little
nest awoke in the breast of this lonely
outsider, his duty and purpose remained
fixed.</p>

<p>In the fall of the year, when the grapes
hung in luscious bunches on the slender
vine; when country by-lanes were mellow
with a wealth of sumach and maple coloring;
when Nature was saying farewell in
her own sweet way, at once so festive and
so melancholy, then Constance and Randolph
turned their backs on the din and
confusion of the city, and seeking the
happy woodlands, entered their own little
home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>On that very same day Steve received
a summons to his sister, who lived with
her mother in the little country town.
There he was witness to a short, sharp
contest with pneumonia; then came a defeat;
and then a quiet burial in the village
churchyard; next a sinking from
hour to hour of the invalid mother whose
prop and stay had been taken from beneath
her; a second calling of friends to
the stricken home; and ere two weeks of
absence had been told, Steve found himself
alone in the world, as far as any near
of kin were concerned.</p>

<p>His grief was quiet, but very poignant.
The old bachelor lodgings became unendurable.
Randolph had gone to a home
of his own, and Steve could not sit there
alone, listening to the clods of earth as
they fell on mother and Mary.</p>

<p>Both Randolph and Constance stretched
out tender, sympathizing hands to the
lonely man, and would have been glad
had he consented to widen their fireside
circle by his presence, but beyond an occasional
visit Steve did not feel that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
could go to them. He had long been independent&mdash;he
was over thirty now, and
he was not ready to merge his life into the
life of another household. Still less was
he willing to intrude his continued presence
upon a newly married couple. The
life there was sacred to him, and although
he felt himself next of kin, almost, to its
inmates, he shrank from robbing them of
their right to be alone.</p>

<p>Go somewhere he must, however, so
he gathered a few of his effects and prepared
for a flitting&mdash;where he hardly
knew when he set out, but he chanced to
alight in the domicile of some elderly
friends, who were delighted to give him
house and table room in their rather solitary
home.</p>

<p>It chanced that Steve's new rookery
(he was in the fourth story) was quite
near Mrs. Lamont's handsome house, and
Mrs. Lamont was the aunt of Nannie
Branscome&mdash;bewitching, provoking, maddening
Nannie Branscome; uncured, unbaked,
indigestible little Nannie Branscome&mdash;and
they met, to quote from Kate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Douglas Wiggin, &#8220;every once in so
often.&#8221;</p>

<p>Careless, irresponsible Nannie Branscome!
growing wild in the garden.</p>

<p>But the cook was near at hand and the
fire was lighted.</p>

<p>What manner of cook? A <i>chef</i> or a
stupid mixer of messes?</p>

<p>Who knows?</p>



<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was bleak and drear. A raw, angry
wind came out of the north and went raging
through the woods, tearing the pretty
clothing of the trees to pieces and rudely
hurling the dust of the street in one's face.
The sun got behind the clouds and in
grief and dismay hid his face while this
dismal looting went on unrebuked and unrestrained.
But Nature is fickle, possibly
because she is feminine. At all
events, she can change both mind and
conduct, and in short order. So ere long
she came out of her November rage and
sat down in still, mellow sunshine, and
gathering her children about her, whispered
beautiful stories in their ears;
warmed them with her love and brightness;
soothed their care-lined brows and
filled their hearts with a sense of the nearness
of the Giver of all good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on one of these days of Indian
summer that Steve cut loose from work
and started off on a tramp. He worked
in town; he rested in country.</p>

<p>He had put something like five miles of
woodland and late fall meadow between
himself and the distractions of city life,
when looking adown a path that sloped
gently to a brook he saw, sitting on a tree
that lay athwart the stream and paddling
her white feet in the sunny water, Nannie
Branscome. His surprise robbed him of
his reserve and he hastened to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you lost, Miss Branscome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered calmly.</p>

<p>She still sat there, paddling her feet,
with nothing of consternation or perplexity
in her face or manner. All around
her were the browns of a summer that
had come and gone; heaps of dead leaves
nestled close to the trees, mute witnesses
of a lost beauty; while here and there an
ox-eyed daisy glowed from out its somber
company as a firefly shines through
the dusk of twilight. In the midst of all
this sat Nannie in her pretty suit trimmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in scarlet, looking like a bird of paradise
amid a flock of sparrows and other soberly
clad creatures. Indeed, she reminded
one of a bird, with her head cocked on one
side and her air&mdash;not bold, but saucy.</p>

<p>Steve stood on the bank of the creek,
perplexed for a moment. Then he asked
with a slight smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl lowered her head a trifle and
looked out at him from 'neath her curls,
but she said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go home, Miss Branscome.&#8221;</p>

<p>She continued looking at him without
a word, and he returned her gaze as he
stood there with a gentle dignity that had
its effect upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barefooted?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I am going to explore this creek
for a little distance, and you can get ready
while I'm gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose my shoes and stockings
have floated down the stream? What
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve was dismayed, but he maintained
his quiet air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; persisted Nannie.</p>

<p>Just then Steve caught a glimpse of a
tiny shoe at the foot of a near tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they have not,
but are awaiting their owner over yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie laughed and looked around and
Steve walked on.</p>

<p>When he returned she was ready, and
they set off together toward town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you really lost?&#8221; asked Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I've been wandering around
for at least two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How came you to go out there?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was expected to go somewhere
else,&#8221; she answered with one of her elfin
looks.</p>

<p>Steve was silent. Mentally he was
wondering if this was the mainspring of
conduct in all women. He thought very
likely it was. Mary often asked his advice
and then always took her own way,
and it was invariably opposite to the
course he had indicated.</p>

<p>They had not gone much further,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
when, happening to look around for
something, Nannie caught a glimpse of
her dress skirt and saw that it was
creased and stained with mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;There now! I've just ruined my
gown!&#8221; she exclaimed, and then burst
into passionate tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Branscome! don't!&#8221; said Steve,
who was fairly startled out of his usual
quiet into something akin to excitement.
&#8220;Don't! I beg of you. Nannie! don't
cry, my dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>He failed to notice how he had spoken;
so did she, apparently.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can make it all right, I know,&#8221; he
continued, but for a time she refused to
be comforted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would cry too, I guess, if you
were in my place and would get such an
awful scolding at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt I would,&#8221; assented Steve in
deep distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I were dead and buried under
a landslide,&#8221; sobbed Nannie.</p>

<p>In the depth of her sorrow she wanted
to delve deep into mother earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. Don't wish that! What
should we do without you?&#8221; said Steve
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn't to worry,&#8221; replied
Nannie pettishly, the violence of her grief
having spent itself. &#8220;Nothing so good
as that is going to happen. I shall live
to get home and have my head taken off,
and stalk around as a torso ever afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now do let me see if I can't set things
to rights,&#8221; said Steve. &#8220;You've no idea
how handy I am in such matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>He proved the truth of his words by
going to work upon the injured gown,
and after patient effort bringing it out of
its dilapidated condition in such shape
that only a keen eye would detect any sign
of mishap.</p>

<p>Nannie was delighted and, stimulated
by the excitement attendant upon her
rapid change of fortunes, became quite
talkative.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn't have minded it so much,
but I have on one of my best gowns, and
Aunt Frances makes such a fuss every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
time she has to buy me anything. She
says it's of no use to spend on me. It
don't amount to a row of pins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve looked at her inquiringly. In
actual time he was many years her senior,
but Nannie had been in society for a season
now, and even young girls age fast
there&mdash;too fast, by far.</p>

<p>&#8220;She means I don't bid fair to get married
off well. I'm not very popular, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Steve was silent. Nannie was
speaking in a language of which he was
ignorant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dressed this morning to go to Joe
Harding's breakfast, but I hate him, and
I went walking instead. Now I've got
to see some of the girls who went and
make up a lot of stuff about it at home,
or Aunt Frances'll be awfully mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve looked into the beautiful face of
the young girl who was talking in this
repellent fashion. Then he took her
gently by the hand and said in a firm,
kindly tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie, you must come out of all
this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I have no
mother or father&mdash;no one who really
cares. I suppose I'll marry Joe Harding
some day. He wants me, and Aunt
Frances keeps at me about it eternally,
but I hate him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not marry him,&#8221; said Steve
firmly. &#8220;He is not a good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he's awfully ugly, too, but he's
rich, and he's one of the swell set. Ugh!
but I do hate him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you going to marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked, looking at him
with straight, frank surprise. &#8220;I've got
to. Nobody else wants me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pettish look had passed from her
face; so also had the world-wise expression.
There was something in her present
na&iuml;ve frankness that prevented it
from seeming bold.</p>

<p>As he looked at her swift images of
love and marriage flitted across his brain.
Somehow his loneliness was borne in
upon him, and with this realization there
came as a sudden flash the consciousness
that he could marry. Long ago he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
put all this one side, and in his grief over
the loss of mother and sister it had never
once occurred to him that he was free.
The knowledge almost overwhelmed him
now, and in his bewilderment for the
moment he lost sight of his ideal. Like
most reticent men, he cherished an ideal.
Since meeting Constance Leigh, unconsciously
to himself that ideal had grown
very like her. But now he was sitting
beside a fascinating young girl&mdash;for fascinating
she was to Steve, even in her
brusqueness and plainness of speech; a
mere child, as it were, who was without
home and without the protection of love
and parental care, and as he looked into
her eyes, still wet with tears, he felt his
heart go out to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Nannie,&#8221; he said, taking
her hand once more. &#8220;I am a very
lonely man. I need a wife&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, ducky, come and be killed,&#8221;
flashed through Nannie's mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you need me and I'm sure I
need you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; thought Nannie; &#8220;fricasseed
or boiled?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would let me I would take you
and try&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fry, you mean,&#8221; said Nannie mentally
as he hesitated.</p>

<p>Then with a sudden whirl, peculiar to
her gusty temperament, she said to herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;He's proposing, and I needn't marry
that hideous creature!&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught her breath and pressed her
hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if only I could escape from Joe
Harding!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Something very holy in Steve's nature
came up then and changed the man. No
longer shy, no longer reserved, he bent
toward Nannie without touching her and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, marriage is a gate at once
solemn and beautiful. When it is used
as a door of escape it opens into a dark
forest abounding with terrible wild beasts
and hideous crawling things, but if one
opens it with love's key, I can't tell you
what it leads to, for I have never been
there, but I believe it is the gateway to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Elysium fields that lie just on the hither
side of heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie looked up into the grave eyes
and saw something of tenderness, something
of reverence there that was new to
her. She had stepped into an unknown
world and was awed. As she sat there
all mockery and levity faded from her
face, and in its place there crept a look of
deep admiration and deep respect for this
man, and something awoke in her soul.</p>

<p>She said not a word&mdash;she had no words
for such as this&mdash;but by and by she put
her hand into Steve's.</p>

<p>&#8220;For life, Nannie?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, and burst into tears.</p>



<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A lover's</span> ecstasy is ofttimes cut short
by the reflection that he has yet to face
that awful bugbear&mdash;the old folk.
There is something terrible about age, it
would seem, not only to its possessor, but
even to those who must encounter it
second hand, and Steve was not without
his qualms. Although in his wooing he
had not for one moment lost his gentle
self-possession, he had entirely forgotten
about the ordeal of an interview with
Nannie's guardians until she reminded
him by saying with an impish chuckle:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won't Aunt Frances be happy when
she hears of this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she anxious that you should
marry?&#8221; asked Steve with some wonder.</p>

<p>Nannie looked at him with wide eyes
for a moment. It seemed hardly possible
that one could be so dull of comprehension,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and yet there was no doubting
Steve's grave, earnest expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was her only reply, but inwardly
she was convulsed with laughter
as she looked ahead and in thought
rapidly sketched a scene.</p>

<p>And so Steve walked up to his task
with but a faint conception of its magnitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have called, Mrs. Lamont,&#8221; he said
in his easy, gentlemanly way, &#8220;to ask for
the hand of your niece. Nannie and I
have had a little talk about it and understand
each other, I think, and now we
await your consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely don't <i>expect</i> my consent,&#8221;
said Mrs. Lamont.</p>

<p>Steve's shyness and gentleness seemed
to return to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really,&#8221; he said hesitatingly, &#8220;had
not thought of any reason why we should
not have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Loveland&mdash;well, this is intensely
trying to me. You've no idea, I am sure,
how I dislike to be so plain; but <i>can</i> you
not understand that you are hardly a suitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
match for Nannie? You are very
poor, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; said Steve gently.</p>

<p>He had a good position on a daily
paper and his mother's little property had
been disposed of to advantage, so that he
had several thousand in bank now. To
him, with his small needs and quiet tastes,
this seemed like wealth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why will you force me to such
brutal plainness!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Lamont
impatiently. &#8220;Really this interview
will make me ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may indeed,&#8221; said Steve.</p>

<p>He had no thought of sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Loveland, this is a business matter.
We must understand each other.
You have property, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now; it was sold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you own, may I ask? Oh,
isn't it fearful to have to talk so! But I
must lead you to see things clearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have forty-five hundred dollars in
bank and a good situation,&#8221; said Steve,
with a feeling that he was turning his life
inside out under a stranger's gaze, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
had returned to barbarism and was buying
Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bringing you what, may I ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A hundred and twenty-five a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamont gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear sir&mdash;excuse me, but
that would not suffice to keep Nannie's
carriage, let alone herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must she have a carriage?&#8221; asked
Steve with a lengthening face.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of course! Would you
expect her to walk?&#8221;</p>

<p>Several things flashed through Steve's
bewildered brain. Until to-day he had
always met Nannie in her own or some
other parlor. She had walked to-day, it
is true, but perhaps she ought not to have
done so. He remembered that when he
saw her feet as she was paddling in the
brook he thought them wonderfully
small. He also recalled the fact that
Chinese women of rank have very small
feet and cannot walk; possibly Nannie
was in a similar predicament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she deformed?&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Lamont put her handkerchief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to her face and wept for vexation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Steve sat there, bewildered
and distressed. He had come to expect
this sort of conduct from women in general,
but it was harrowing. His poor invalid
mother often wept; Mary had cried
now and then, poor worn-out girl; and
last week, when he was at her house, even
Constance had burst into tears when
Randolph tried to explain something to
her; Nannie had cried that day, and now
Mrs. Lamont was weeping. No doubt
it was a sort of melancholy punctuation
mark in vogue with the sex.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidently we speak different languages,
and it is an almost hopeless task
to try to explain,&#8221; said the lady at length;
&#8220;but Nannie's interests are at stake, and
I must attempt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew only too well how futile it
would be to try to influence Nannie. If
this affair were ended it must be by Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you not see,&#8221; she continued, emphasizing
every word and speaking in a
hard, metallic tone, &#8220;that Nannie's position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in society calls for certain expenditures
which are far beyond your means?
As a woman of fashion she will be obliged
to keep a carriage and maintain a
style of living which would eat up your
monthly salary in half a day. She has a
suitor of abundant means, a millionaire
several times over&mdash;Mr. Harding. He is
infatuated with her and he will give her
everything she can desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is a very bad man,&#8221; said Steve
simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well&mdash;really, Mr. Loveland,
please don't push me into a discussion of
such matters. Few men are saints, and
I think he'll make a good husband. He
is very rich and he moves in the best circles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Nannie love him?&#8221; asked Steve,
and his voice and manner had changed.
He spoke very firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Loveland, you <i>exhaust</i> me!
Some of us who have reached maturity
have the good sense to provide for
material advantages and take the rest for
granted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Nannie loves Mr. Harding and
wishes me to withdraw in his favor, I will
do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't!&#8221; said a curt voice, and looking
around with a start, Mrs. Lamont beheld
her dutiful niece between the <i>porti&egrave;res</i>.</p>

<p>For a moment nothing was said, but
Nannie's appearance did not portend
peace. Her eyes looked out wickedly
from beneath her curls, and her impish
mouth was pursed up in an expression
already familiar to her aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the room instantly!&#8221; cried
Mrs. Lamont at last with rising anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won't!&#8221; said Nannie shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will teach you that I also can
be firm. I command you to break off this
foolish, insane affair at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won't!&#8221; said Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ungrateful minx!&#8221; cried Mrs. Lamont.
&#8220;Here I have dressed you all
these years and gone to no end of other
expense, and this is how you repay me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Nannie.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Lamont was a shrewd,
worldly woman, and she took in the situation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
fully. She realized that Nannie
would hold to her own course. She also
realized that arguments such as hers were
without weight with Steve. These two,
then, would marry for all she could say
or do, for Nannie was just come of age.
Now she had already strained her means
to provide for the fashionable necessities
of Nannie's <i>d&eacute;but</i> and society life, and she
dreaded her wedding. Had the child
married well, however, all the monetary
effort attendant upon the occasion could
have been repaid afterward&mdash;all that and
more; but now to have an outlay and no
return&mdash;that was too much! She would
avert it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do nothing with this saucy, impudent
girl, this ungrateful creature, but
I appeal to you,&#8221; she said to Steve, &#8220;to let
her come to her senses.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Lamont, he thought, who
was worse than mad to try to force a
young girl into an odious marriage, and
Nannie's rebellion seemed justifiable to
him, unused though he himself was to defying
any one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie and I have decided,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;I regret that you feel so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall never be married from this
house!&#8221; cried the aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go elsewhere,&#8221; said Steve, not
realizing that he was walking into a net.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you may expect a bitter time
after this conduct, miss,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lamont,&#8221; said Steve, stepping
forward and taking Nannie's little hand in
his, &#8220;you will force us to an earlier marriage
than we had contemplated.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Steve was well in the toils of
the net, and this was how it happened that
Mrs. Lamont was spared further expense
for her willful niece, and that Steve all
but took Randolph's and Constance's
breath away by inviting them to a very
quiet wedding which was to take place at
a church one morning about a week after
this stormy scene, and society buzzed like
a bee over the elopement, as it called it,
and so forth, and so on, and all at once
in the midst of the distractions Nannie
caught her breath and cried out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, goodness me! I'm married!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And Steve received the news with
almost equal dismay.</p>

<p>Really, if the Shah of Persia had presented
this gentleman with a white elephant,
with long flowing trunk and two
tails&mdash;three or four tails, in fact&mdash;and
this little gift had been brought up to his
room on a silver salver (always supposing
that were possible) he could not have felt
much more nonplussed as to its proper disposal
and care than he did when he suddenly
came out of a dream to realize he
had a wife on his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you wish to live, my dear?&#8221;
he asked in a tone that might imply that
he had all Europe and America to draw
from as a place of residence.</p>

<p>He was rather expecting Nannie to say
that she wished to reside on Calumet
Avenue and to have a coach and four purchased
that very day.</p>

<p>But nothing could surprise him now, so
he received her abrupt answer calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to live in the country, near
Mrs. Chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Happily this wish was not impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of fulfillment, so Steve at once consulted
his friends, and after much walking about
(Nannie could walk) and much discussion,
the four agreed upon a small dovecote
of a place about a mile from Randolph's
and Constance's home&mdash;a dear
little cottage with enough land about it
to raise anything and everything.</p>

<p>Nannie was like a child with a new toy,
and her delight lent her a hundred little
airs and graces that would only have provoked
Mrs. Lamont had she seen them.
She always said that the child was rude
and stupid in society where she should
have done her best, and only fascinating
with people who could be of no earthly
use to her.</p>

<p>And now the little kitchen was set up,
the fire was burning briskly, the cook was
at hand, and the delectable, indigestible
material was ready for the spit.</p>



<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> people born and bred for city life
<i>will</i> take to the woods; why people
shapen, as it were, for the plow will fly
to town, and men built for a naval gait
will attempt to sit in high places on shore,
is one of those elusive problems that are
forever defying solution. We only know
that such things exist, and a few of us
come up and have a crack at them, as it
were, and fail to make the slightest impression
on their thick skulls. And still
the wonder grows. Now it is a naval
hero come ashore from seas where he was
master of the situation, laden with honors
and refulgent with glory sufficient for the
lifetime of ten reasonable men, who
straightway begins to covet a chair of
whose very shape and proportions he is
ignorant, and in which he can only be conspicuous
as a melancholy misfit. O Heroism!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
why failest them to reach the judgment?
O Glory! why canst thou not
touch up the common sense? Anon we
have a yeoman who has struck oil and has
been thrown up on high by its monetary
power, forsaking the obscure nook for
which nature shaped him and attempting
to sit in our drawing-room, eat at our
dinner-table, and obtrude his rich vulgarity
upon gentler guests.</p>

<p>It was in accordance with this lamentable
fashion of undertaking that for which
they have no gift; this rushing in of certain
folk where angels fear to tread, that
Steve turned farmer. Not that he gave
up his situation on the paper. Ah, no!
He tried to be that which no man could
be successfully without supernatural aid&mdash;journalist
and farmer both. His work in
the city had for some time been such that
he could do much of it in his room if he
chose; indeed, there were times&mdash;a day,
occasionally&mdash;when it was not necessary
to go near the office. Consequently when
he repaired to the country with his unique
wife, he thought his affairs were admirably
adapted to a dual existence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the merry month of April
when they landed. I use the latter term
advisedly, for they were indeed upon a
foreign shore. All about them Nature
was giving evidence of a present awakening
from her long nap. With her quickening
circulation there was increased
warmth, and in this the snow speedily
slipped away. A chorus of songsters
came out to greet the newly wedded pair,
and sang so sweetly of love that Steve's
delicate, sensitive nature thrilled in response.
Nannie listened and looked at
them askance, but to her they spoke, like
our opera singers, in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p>Now, this breaking Steve from off his
natural tree and grafting him upon an
alien bough occasioned some changes.
From being cheerful, slow, and gentle he
suddenly became anxious, hasty, and at
times dictatorial.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have a garden,&#8221; one of his
neighbors said.</p>

<p>Steve went to work like a galley slave
upon his spare days, and dug, and raked,
and planted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You must keep bees,&#8221; said another of
the neighbors.</p>

<p>Steve bought two hives at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must keep chickens,&#8221; said another
neighbor, a sort of two-edged woman,
who dwelt over across the swamp and
whose scolding voice could be heard for
miles.</p>

<p>So Steve bought thirteen hens and a
rooster.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have a cow,&#8221; said a fourth
neighbor, and he promptly sold Steve a
cantankerous beast that wanted to rival
him in authority, and indeed for a time
ran the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have a cat,&#8221; said an old
woman who wanted to get rid of an unamiable
Thomas, and Steve brought him
home in a sack caterwauling all the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must get a dog,&#8221; said a man who
had a bull terrier for sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've got one!&#8221; bawled Steve&mdash;the man
was deaf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bull terrier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Scotch! and he's all I want!&#8221; and
Steve closed the front door with needless
vigor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What did you buy those nasty hens
for?&#8221; asked Nannie, who did not like
chickens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they'll give us something good to
eat. It will be so nice to go out every
morning and bring in some new-laid eggs
for breakfast. You'll like to do that,
Nannie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you'd better,&#8221; she said with a
peculiar look.</p>

<p>So the next morning Steve tiptoed out,
through the wet grass, to the hen-house,
in his dressing-gown and slippers, he was
so eager to pluck this new fruit.</p>

<p>He came in empty-handed, but cheerful.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could hardly expect them to lay
the first day; they have got to get their
bearings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every morning before breakfast Steve
took this little walk. There was soon a
well-beaten track between the back door
and the hen-house. He always returned
empty-handed, and Nannie watched with
an impish smile from an upper window.</p>

<p>One morning she came upon him in the
act of taking off a white door-knob.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you doing?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>He looked guilty, but answered with a
fair show of spirit:</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to put this in one of the
nests. You see, they must think a hen
has been there and laid it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn't waste time eating the
eggs of hens that would be such fools as
to think any poor old chicken had laid that
door-knob!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Steve put it in, nevertheless.</p>

<p>And still morning after morning, with
lowered head and dragging footstep,
he returned to the house alone&mdash;still
alone; not so much as a single egg as
companion.</p>

<p>Then it was that a pair of imp-like,
black eyes danced 'neath the careless ringlets
above them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you like your door-knob
this morning&mdash;hard or soft?&#8221;</p>

<p>This raillery went on day after day until
even Steve&mdash;gentle, patient Steve had
enough.</p>

<p>He looked up at the window and said
quietly, but firmly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There, Nannie, drop it, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On toast?&#8221; she screamed, and Steve
went into the house.</p>

<p>But his triumph was near at hand, for
one morning, about four weeks after he
had bought the chickens, he discovered
something besides the door-knob in one of
the nests, and forthwith came strutting
toward the house, holding the egg on
high that Nannie might see it from the
window of her room.</p>

<p>Hearing no noise he looked up. Was
she dead? Ah, no! There she sat,
straining her eyes through a field-glass to
see the yield of his first month.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mix well,&#8221; she called to him, &#8220;thirteen
hens, one rooster, one door-knob, and one
month, and you'll have a delicious egg.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again Steve got into the house.</p>

<p>He was obliged to come out again
later on, for there were many things upon
this miniature plantation which were
clamoring for attention. Indeed, Steve
was slowly coming to believe in communities,
such associations meaning in his mind
a body of men banded together to run a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
small acre of ground; one man attending
to the chickens, one to the fruit trees, one
to the vegetable garden, one to the horse,
several to the cow, and so on. It will
be seen later on why, in this distribution of
labor, Steve always assigned several men&mdash;able-bodied
at that&mdash;to the cow. It has
already been mentioned that he was persuaded
early in his matrimonial career to
buy a beast of this variety. This beautiful
animal (for she was handsome, unless
she be judged by the homely rule that
regulates beauty by conduct) he immediately
presented to Nannie. Whether she
was originally vicious (and this her former
owner vehemently denied) or was
affected by the nature of her mistress, no
one knows. Suffice it to say that upon
Nannie's flying out of the house to gaze
upon her new possession, the latter lowered
her head, raised her tail like a flagstaff,
and galloped to meet her, and it was
only by the execution of a sort of double-barreled
backward somersault that Nannie
saved her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most extraordinary conduct,&#8221; said
Steve. &#8220;Threatening from both ends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie was in no wise dismayed, and
either by reason of her fearlessness or because
of a secret bond between their natures,
she and Sarah Maria&mdash;for so she
named her after a troublesome neighbor&mdash;became
comrades after a fashion. Between
Sarah Maria and Brownie, however,
there was always war from horn to
heel, and nothing could effect a reconciliation.
The danger of this enmity was
clearly demonstrated on a Sabbath morning,
otherwise peaceful, when Nannie
started out with Brownie (the former
carrying a milk pail, for some reason best
known to herself, since she knew nothing
of milking) and went down to the pasture
for Sarah Maria. The latter was awaiting
them at the bars, and, as it appeared,
was ready for the business of the day.
No sooner was she liberated from the
bondage of the pasture than she made a
bold charge upon Brownie, who promptly
took to cover behind his mistress, barking
the while in a manner both rasping and
aggravating to one of Sarah Maria's irritable
nervous system. The bovine's attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
being now drawn to Nannie, it
behooved the latter to clear the path, and
in short order, and Steve, who came running
to the scene, attracted by the din of
battle, beheld with horror-stricken sight
a confused medley consisting of wife,
dog, Sarah Maria, milk pail&mdash;all going
head over heels into the nearest ditch.</p>

<p>By some miracle no one was hurt, and
an energetic use of the milk pail&mdash;a use
unforeseen by the manufacturers&mdash;restored
quiet to the agitated district.</p>

<p>It was soon after this escapade that
Jacob, the man about the place thought
himself called to some other profession
than farming, and accordingly left. As
Sarah Maria remained, it was necessary
to secure a milker. This difficulty was
happily surmounted about eleven o'clock
the first morning, when a man selling
rustic chairs appeared upon the scene and
good-naturedly consented for the time
to step within the breach made by Jacob's
disappearance.</p>

<p>Later on it was borne in on Steve's consciousness
that he was the man to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Sarah Maria must look for relief. The
situation was a critical one, but Steve's
was not a nature to shirk responsibilities
or shun sacrifices. Accordingly, arming
himself with a hatchet and a club, on the
end of which latter instrument he suspended
the milk pail, he set out, and in
this new business worked with such gentle
deliberation that at the end of an hour he
could have shown a quart of milk for his
pains had not Sarah Maria testified to
her respect for the day of small things by
lifting the aforementioned pail on high.</p>

<p>By the end of a week, however, Steve
succeeded in bringing his milking lessons
to a favorable conclusion, and was ready
to take his place not among the best, it is
true, but still among the milkers of the
world. He must have prosecuted his education
with remarkable ardor, for his
overalls had given out in spots, and one
industrious day Nannie took it into her
head to patch them. Having no suitable
material at hand&mdash;such is the misfortune
of the newly wedded, with everything
whole about them&mdash;she utilized some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Scotch plaid pieces left over from a tea
gown. But hardly was the patch well set
than she began to reflect that its rather
conspicuous beauty would no doubt catch
the eye of Sarah Maria, and might occasion
nothing less than Steve's death if he
were taken unawares when his back was
turned. To extract the patch was not to
be thought of for a moment, since it was
a wonderful triumph of art for Nannie,
nor could she consent, wicked though she
was, to let Steve walk forth arrayed in all
its glory. A bottle of shoe polish solved
the problem and made a somewhat stiff
but subdued foundation, upon which Steve
rested with more or less insecurity.</p>



<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning Nannie was out in the
garden, not at work as she should have
been (she left all that to Steve), but
walking around in a sort of lordly way,
after the fashion of many idlers in this
world who without scruple appropriate
the results of industry.</p>

<p>She had often noted an old codger
whose place backed up on hers, but had
never held any converse with him. This
morning, however, he seemed inclined to
break the ice, as it were, for as she
strutted about he leaned on the fence and
said cheerily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, neighbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie gave one glance at his old
broad-brimmed straw hat and rusty overalls,
and then said with a certain winning
sauciness all her own:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, old Hayseed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The man laughed. He had a rotund,
jovial countenance, which even his
smoked glasses could not plunge into
gloom. His every feature had an upward
turn, and there was something
strong and good about the face that made
one feel that his heart also curved upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;So ye're gard'nin', be yer?&#8221; he remarked
by way of introduction.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain't,&#8221; said Nannie curtly.
&#8220;Steve gardens, and you know it.
You've seen him bent like a bow over
these beds ever since we came here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that's so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I've held myself as straight as an
arrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now thet's so, too,&#8221; and the old man
laughed. &#8220;Ye're cute, yer air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see right ahead of me. I don't
wear smoked glasses,&#8221; said Nannie with
a pretty little grimace.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a deal goes on ahind smoked
glasses sometimes,&#8221; said the old fellow
with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you keep house?&#8221; asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Nannie with an abrupt change of subject.
&#8220;You haven't any wife or daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't keep it; jest trust it. Don't
turn no key nor nothin' on it, an' I ain't
never knowed it to stray outside ther
yard. Ther's a heap in hevin' faith in
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie's face grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer kin 'most b'lieve a man inter
bein' honest, an' I reckon it acts ther same
on wimmin, though they be a leetle different.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie looked up from under her curls
with a glance half inquiring, half defiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;When wimmin's young they be like
a colt&mdash;it's hard ter keep 'em stiddy.
When they git older they be somethin'
like a mule&mdash;it's hard ter start 'em up
now an' agin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess men are the same. They belong
to the same stock&mdash;all the world's
akin, you know,&#8221; said Nannie mischievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the world's akin, eh?&#8221; said the old
man slowly, turning this thought over in
his mind. &#8220;Well, now, mebbe thet's so,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
but if it is ther's a deal of difference atween
ther cousins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Nannie's face grew thoughtful.
Then she raised her eyes and pointed,
with a little laugh, to a passer-by.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes one kind of a cousin, I
suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He's a coon,&#8221; said the old man.
&#8220;Him an' his mother, they live off yonder
nigh ther swamp. They used ter own
this 'ere place ye're on, an' then it passed
ter ther datter, an' then her husban'
bought it. She's in ther insane asylum
now, an' these rel'tives claim she ain't
crazy, but thet she was put in by ther
malice of her husban'. An' they claim
he's got ther place wrongful, an' hadn't a
right ter sell ter you folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's why they're bothering us so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet's why,&#8221; said old Hayseed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they'll find we're <i>two</i> many for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then with a sudden burst of laughter
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I'm going to egg Steve on to a
fight! Wouldn't it be fun! I wonder
if Steve could fight!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon he could,&#8221; said the old man
with a gleam in his eye that seemed to
pierce the darkness of his glasses. &#8220;He
don't look it exact an' his manners don't
promise it, but ther may be fight in him
somewhere. Ther be men, yer know,
can't talk even about ther weather without
shakin' a fist in yer face. He ain't
thet kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. If he were he would have murdered
Sarah Maria long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would thet, fer a fact. Then
ther's others thet air so afeard&mdash;so skeart
thet a two-year-old bootblack or ther
shadder of publick derishion could put 'em
ter flight. Be thet his kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not!&#8221; blazed Nannie. &#8220;Steve's
afraid of nothing, living or dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he ain't afeard. I kin see thet;
but he's peaceable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at this moment Nannie glanced
down the sloping sides of the ravine and
saw Hilda Bretherton panting her way up
toward the house. Now, these two had
not met since Hilda married and started
off on her wedding trip to France, shortly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
before Nannie became engaged. True to
the usual direction of her popularity,
Hilda had married a small man, beside
whom she looked the good-natured giantess
she indeed was, but he was enormously
rich, and in her particular set she was accounted
one of fortune's favorites.</p>

<p>Since casting her lot in the country
Nannie had been into town but little.
For society as she had known it she
cared nothing. Then, too, marriage had
entered the magic circle of the Young
Woman's Club and changed its membership,
so that Nannie felt herself an alien.
She was not consciously lonely in the
country, but yet there was something so
significant in the glad cry she uttered
when she caught sight of Hilda, and the
unusual warmth of her greeting, that old
Hayseed looked on from his side of the
fence with a meditative air.</p>

<p>&#8220;The colt's a-yearnin' fer somethin'
without knowin' it,&#8221; he said to himself
as Nannie dragged Hilda into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought not to sit down,&#8221; Hilda
panted. &#8220;Oh, dear! Let me get my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
breath! Do you see how awfully fat I
am? and my husband don't weigh but a
hundred and twenty&mdash;think of that! A
sparrow for a protector! If ever I
wanted to get behind him to escape a
mouse or anything, what should I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; asked Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;the mouse?&#8221; screamed Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nannie, &#8220;the husband;&#8221;
and then the two fell a-laughing in the
old foolish way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Husband! Oh, I thought you'd have
something of that kind around, and one
would be enough for to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, really! Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over on the other side of the ravine.
You see, we missed the road and got entangled
in the forest. Ye gods! how literally
you've taken to the woods, Nannie!
Well, DeLancy didn't feel he was equal
to a climb, so I came alone, presumably
to find the road, but I couldn't go on without
seeing you, so I've stolen a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You'd better!&#8221; said Nannie. &#8220;If
ever you pass me by I'll haunt you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that. I always was afraid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
you. I always said you were a
little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; said Nannie, imitating Prudence
Shaftsbury's air and manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old Prue!&#8221; said Hilda. &#8220;I saw
her the other day. I believe she's really
happy. She don't say much, but she
looks it. She's awfully swell, too.
Why, you hear Mrs. Ralph Porter on all
sides. She leads everything. That girl
has more tact and diplomacy than any one
I ever saw. Awfully nice girl, too.
Here I am, always putting my foot in it.
DeLancy says I fling a rope around my
neck so surely as I open my mouth, and
with each succeeding word I give it a
jerk. Oh, dear me! I ought to be going.
He'll be wild! Why, you don't
look any too well. What's the matter
with you, Nan? Aren't you happy,
child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Mind your business!&#8221; said
Nannie in the old defiant way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me! bless me! You haven't
changed a mite! I thought marriage
would improve you. Oh, do you know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Evelyn Rogers was married the other
day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nannie with quickened interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;not at her home. She was visiting
her aunt in New York, and there she
married her villainous-looking professor,
and would you believe it? I heard they
went right off to the slums on a wedding
trip, taking a thief, and an anarchist, and
a murderer with them, as chaperons, I
suppose. Oh, I ought to be going!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the slums?&#8221; asked Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. I ought to get out of here.
DeLancy is insane by this time, I know!
I <i>must</i> run!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hilda, you sit still and cool off!
You've just been in a stew ever since you
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm in one all the time. Do you remember
what some of you girls said of
me at that first meeting of the club&mdash;I'd
be kept in a continual stew? Never were
truer words spoken. Oh!&#8221; and she
groaned loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don't you get done&mdash;with it?&#8221;
asked Nannie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I can't,&#8221; said Hilda coolly. &#8220;I'm in
for it now and must go on to the bitter
end. It's too late to chew the cud of reflection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't count on the end,&#8221; laughed
Nannie, looking at her friend's rotund
figure. &#8220;There's no end to you, Hilda.
You're an all-round woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I am! If you could only see
the number of offices I fill. I'm nurse,
doctor, valet, messenger, and on cross
days general vent for the humors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he really ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don't know. He has dyspepsia.
I guess he don't feel any too well, and
nothing pleases him. He took a notion
that a sea voyage would cure him, and it
didn't. He snarled and snapped all the
way, and oh, I was so sick&mdash;ugh! and I
had to drag myself around after him.
Then next he tried the German baths.
He's tried everything, and now&mdash;oh,
now,&#8221; she continued with a groan, putting
her handkerchief to her face, &#8220;he says that
society is injurious to him. And what do
you suppose he has done?&#8221; she asked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
raising her voice and peering from above
the handkerchief which she had pressed
to her face. &#8220;He's rented a lonely cabin
in the Adirondacks for a year&mdash;a year!
and there I'm to live! Imagine me, my
dear! I shall grow so rusty that when I
return to civilization I shall only be able
to hang on the back door and creak while
others are talking. Mercy upon us!
there's DeLancy! He'll find me visiting!
I'll never hear the last of this as long as
I live! Where can I go? What can I
get under? Oh, there's nothing big
enough in all the world to cover me!
Woe is me! I must always remain in
the open!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie down there,&#8221; said Nannie authoritatively.
&#8220;I'll cover you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; screamed Hilda. &#8220;You! Oh,
you elf! you brownie! you mite&mdash;you
widow's mite! What could you cover?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie down! Be quick! The enemy
approaches!&#8221; cried Nannie, convulsed
with laughter.</p>

<p>Hilda gave one glance from out the
window and then fell flat on the divan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am lost!&#8221; she groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll defend you,&#8221; said Nannie bravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You! Oh, you atom! you molecule!
you microbe! What can you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet. You are dead&mdash;do you
hear? You're <i>dead</i>&mdash;dead as a doornail;
dead as a mummy&mdash;the mummy
that walked the streets of Thebes when
Moses was a young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nannie did not hear, for she was
running to meet the enemy, a bit of a man
who looked like a woodland sprite as he
walked along the edge of the ravine. In
contrast with the big figure that lay
prone upon the divan, his size was really
ridiculous. Had his pettiness been
merely external, that would not have
mattered. Small men have been known
to tower as giants before us. Luther was
called the little monk, and the Corsican
who altered the world's map was of still
smaller proportions.</p>

<p>This little creature, however, was the
reverse of Julia Ward Howe's youthful
daughter, who announced to an offending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
visitor that she was &#8220;big inside,&#8221; inasmuch
as he was made on a small pattern,
within as well as without.</p>

<p>His petty face was all puckered up
when Nannie encountered him, and his
rasping voice was at its most irritating
pitch.</p>

<p>The moment he was within hailing distance
he began his complaint, heedless
even of the courtesy of a greeting. He
declared he was too exhausted to take
another step; that he had lost his wife,
and he asked if Nannie had seen her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Seymour! Hilda&mdash;Hilda&mdash;is&mdash;at
my house&mdash;dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; he fairly screamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started toward the house with the
speed of the wind, but Nannie stopped
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Wait! Oh,
I'm so excited I'm all mixed up! She's
had an awful spell, but she's better now;
but you mustn't startle her. Something's
the matter with her heart. It was beating
like a sledge-hammer&mdash;an awful
spell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if she dies, who'll take care of me?
What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he wrung his weak little hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;She won't die, I guess, if we take good
care of her. Oh, it's awful to have anything
of this kind happen when you're out
in the country miles from a doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have been crazy enough to rent
a cottage in the Adirondacks!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie looked at him solemnly and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll let it stand idle! Hilda might die
up there! I never thought of such a
thing, she looks so well. And <i>I</i> might be
taken worse,&#8221; he gasped as one who suddenly
realized a still more awful possibility.
&#8220;It would never do for us to go up
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie looked still more solemn and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the
house, and Mr. Seymour was tiptoeing
about, getting out one remedy after another
for his prostrate wife, who feebly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
assured him she was better. By the time
he had given her smelling salts, a little
port, a whiff of ammonia, some soda and
water, a smell of camphor, and had
bathed her forehead in Florida water,
alcohol, witch-hazel, and rubbed it with
camphor ice and a menthol pencil, the
case began to look really serious, and
Hilda was honestly ill.</p>

<p>She lay on the divan, perspiring and
uncomfortable, uneasy in conscience and
timorous as to results, until near evening,
when her husband, with many a misgiving,
took her away in a carriage&mdash;not to
the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>Nannie watched until they were out of
sight, and when she turned she saw Steve
coming, and in her swift way contrasted
him with DeLancy Seymour.</p>

<p>That evening after dinner, without a
word of explanation to her husband, Nannie
walked off to the house of her cousin,
Mr. Misfit. Now, Steve was by this time
somewhat accustomed to her eccentric
ways and seldom questioned them, nor
did he realize that they were eccentric.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
He had grown up knowing very little of
women and regarding them as a peculiar
class, which no doubt they are. Indeed,
his rural experiences, not only with his
wife, but also with the hens and with
Sarah Maria, had tended toward the inclusion
of the entire sex under the head
incomprehensible, and he was inclined to
treat them like difficult words, which we
point at from a distance without attempting
to grapple.</p>

<p>He might have maintained this let-alone
attitude indefinitely but for a growing
sense of the total depravity of vegetable
sins and a realization of his miserable insufficiency
as a combatant. Naturally, in
looking about him for assistance he
thought of her who should be his help-meet,
and mentally began to question her
continual absence from home. This evening
he was feeling a little more tired than
usual, and an ill-selected luncheon in
town had depressed him. When he found
that the weeds were likely to overpower
him he arose and decided that Nannie
must be called upon. She was not at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
home, but he could fetch her. To be
sure that might not be easy, but Steve was
now fully roused. Prolonged warfare
had developed in his nature a trace of
pugilism hitherto unsuspected by his
nearest friend. Every man has more or
less of the warrior within him. It may
be asleep, but it is there, and Steve was no
exception.</p>

<p>A short walk brought him to the house
of Nannie's cousin, and there he found
the lady for whom he was seeking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going home now, Nannie?&#8221;
he asked in his usual gentle way.</p>

<p>Nannie looked into his face and saw
something new, and it roused her opposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Now, Steve had read Ian Maclaren's
story of the wretched beadle who, newly
inflated, but not profited, by his lonely
wedding journey to a Presbyterian synod,
resolved to experiment in the exercise of
authority upon his bride. But, alas! he
had read to his destruction. He remembered
with what majesty the beadle said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Rebecca, close the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did not remember what Rebecca
did, and hence had no better sense than to
say this evening, with a quiet firmness
new to his domestic use:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to have you go home
now, Nannie. There are matters that
need your attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie rose at once and walked home
without a word, Steve accompanying her.
By the time they got there a young moon
was sinking in the west, and with the curiosity
common to extreme youth it strained
its eyes to see through the trees what Nannie
would do.</p>

<p>&#8220;The radishes and lettuce need weeding,&#8221;
said Steve when they reached the
garden, and Nannie walked directly to
these beds and went to work, while Steve
occupied himself at a little distance.</p>

<p>Before long old Hayseed came up and
leaned upon the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, neighbor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what are
ye doin' by moonlight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie stood erect and looked at him.
Her black eyes fairly scintillated and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
lips were compressed. All around her
were scattered the uprooted weeds, and
the lettuce and radishes lay with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What crop air ye raisin' now?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm raising Cain!&#8221; she said.</p>



<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Spite</span> is a whip that cracks at both
ends, and the rear lash inflicts by far the
sharper sting. Nannie felt its full force
when she arose early the next morning
after the sowing of her peculiar crop, and
looking from the window saw the sad
traces of her work lying upon the ground.
The evening before she had walked into
the house tingling with ignoble triumph,
but this morning she felt nothing but
shame as she speculated on Steve's attitude.
Possibly&mdash;this flashed across her
mind&mdash;Steve had not seen her work, and
she might plant those wretched things
again before he wakened. But this poor
solace was denied her, for on peeping into
Steve's room she saw that he was already
up. Where was he? Not working in the
garden as usual; off&mdash;somewhere.</p>

<p>In her ignorance of character such as
his and in the newness of her emotions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
for Nannie was not used to contribution,
she exaggerated matters and fancied that
Steve, thoroughly disgusted with her conduct
(as well he might be), had walked off
and left her. The sharpness of her terror
as she conceived such a possibility
took even herself by surprise. Until this
moment it had never entered her mind
that she might love her husband. Even
now she did not fully comprehend the
meaning of her unusual emotion. She
only knew that she felt shame-stricken
over what she had done and terrified before
possible consequences.</p>

<p>Her fears, however, were without substantial
foundation. Steve had not as
yet seen the uprooted garden, and consequently
was still ignorant of her ill-humor.
Long confinement to a work for
which he was unfitted had worn upon
him, and he felt the need of rest and
change. As of old, in his weariness he
looked to the woods and streams for refreshment,
for although poorly adapted to
the wringing of his daily bread from the
soil, he was nevertheless exquisitely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
keyed to the harmonies of Nature, and
her touch upon his soul was life.</p>

<p>It had been long since he had taken
an early morning tramp. In the city his
midnight retirement forbade the snapping
of his hours of rest at dawn, but now that
his life was ordered somewhat differently,
he could afford himself the luxury of a
sunrise.</p>

<p>With this plan in mind he retired early
after setting the hand of his clock at the
hour of four.</p>

<p>The alarm went off with a furious
bur-r-r that brought him on his feet
through sheer astonishment. He had not
been wakened in such summary fashion
since his last hunting trip, years and years
ago. After staring at the still whirring
clock for a moment as he sat on the edge
of his bed stupid with astonishment, he
collected himself and began a hasty toilet.
He experienced something of a boy's glee
as he donned his clothes, and when he
crept softly downstairs and unbarred the
house door, he seemed to be reviving
some of his boyish escapades.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not difficult to reach the woods,
for the little suburb was embraced by
these primitive arms, and it was like a
child's running to a waiting mother to go
out to them. He took no road or given
path for a time, merely tramping through
the underbrush that tangled the woodland;
along the edges of ravines; down
into their shadowy depths; up again;
now breaking through the bramble out
into the open on the edge of the bluff
that skirts the lake; then bounding back
again, like a rabbit running to covert.
He inhaled with delight the dampness that
rose from the ground and from the vegetation
about him. In the spring, and in
the early summer there is something so
hopeful, so suggestive of awakening life
in that fragrant moisture, that it seems to
call forth an answering energy. Steve
felt its significance in full force, and
fairly thrilled with delight as it permeated
his being.</p>

<p>Now he was out again, following the
sweep of the bluff and looking eastward
over the big waters. Some days the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
appeared there in regal splendor, but on
this particular morning there was a delicacy
about the picture suggestive of the
careful work on one of Turner's loveliest.
There was no gorgeous red, no blazing
gold, but tints as exquisite as those seen
in the heart of an abalone shell&mdash;still
lakes of sea-green feathered about by a
fleecy white just touched with the yellow
of the daisy; lambent wings of gray,
kissed into a roseate hue as they spread
outward and upward toward the zenith;
and the expectant waters on the lake
trembling 'neath their answering pink.</p>

<p>Steve stood and faced it all, hat in
hand. His locks were stirred by the
slight fresh breeze that came over the
lake, and something else was stirred
within him. There was a fine look on his
face. The physical had disappeared. He
no longer felt that strong animal buoyancy
akin to the strength of the wild
horse as he courses the prairies, but his
soul was answering &#8220;Here&#8221; to the call
from the skies.</p>

<p>He turned by-and-by and walked onward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in a still mood&mdash;the receptive mood
into which God sows rare seed. He was
walking away from the sunrise now out
toward the Skokie, that great bog, but he
could see the west flushing with delight&mdash;could
see the windows of a cottage far
ahead blazing with reflected glory.</p>

<p>He reached the cottage ere long.
There were no signs of life about it as yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm the first man up,&#8221; Steve thought,
smiling as he went on.</p>

<p>The little home put the finishing touch
to the picture, and Steve looked at it so
long and so intently that he might have
been accused of rudeness had the occupants
seen him. His thoughts, however,
were anything but rude, for a home had
always been sacred to him. Had he acted
at the bidding of his fine instinct, he
would have raised his hat and stood uncovered
in its presence. Since his marriage
a home had taken on a deeper meaning.
Without losing a jot of its sacredness,
it had come to stand for something
of pain. On his walk that morning he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>had noted many things with new eyes&mdash;the
flowers gladdening the face of nature;
the trees rearing their proud heads and
standing each in his own place&mdash;each doing
his own work; the birds trilling their
songs of praise and stirring in the soul
those holy aspirations whose feet scarce
touch the earth and whose face is set
toward heaven&mdash;all these doing the
Father's work and answering with the
quick response of perfect obedience, perfect
sympathy to the divine will. Viewing
them now with a soul made receptive
by the tender sadness of real life, Steve
asked himself over and over again, Am I
fulfilling the divine mission?</p>

<p>When he reached home his face wore
a thoughtful look, and the question of the
morning lay deep within his eyes as he
walked into the garden and came upon
Nannie's work. For a long time he stood
there gazing at it. An ordinary man
would have been intensely angry, and
whatever good he might have felt or purposed
during his walk would have taken
wings.</p>

<p>But it did not occur to Steve just then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to be angry. Up to this time, like most
another really thoughtful person, he had
done very little actual thinking, but now
he was entered upon a life which is God's
own school for the development of character,
and in the mental and spiritual
awakening of which he was only dimly
conscious he began to see that many
things which he had hitherto accepted as
a matter of course were in reality the result
of causes which could and should be
removed. Passion blurs the vision, and
Steve was straining his eyes to see just
then, so it was necessary above all things
that he should hold himself in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes Nannie act so?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the question he was asking
as he stood by his despoiled garden, and
the answer began to come to him in a
shadowy sort of way. It was not just
what he imagined it would be&mdash;not just
what he would have wished it to be. Few
answers take on the shape we anticipate
or desire, but it was undeniably an answer,
and he turned, possibly in obedience,
to a cool, shady nook near by, and plucking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a few late violets which were growing
there, went into the house where Nannie
sat alone at breakfast, and laying these
gently on the table beside her, without a
word went on his way to the station and
took his usual train.</p>

<p>For a long time after he had left the
house Nannie sat there, her breakfast untasted,
her elbows resting on the table,
her hands clasped under her chin. She
was not looking at the violets, but their
subtle fragrance permeated her thought
as it were. Never in all her life before
had she been treated in this way; never
before had she known of anything of this
kind outside the covers of a book. She
was not conscious of shame, sorrow, or
even regret; she was simply stupid with
wonder.</p>

<p>She got up by-and-by and walked
toward the parlor, but looking back to the
table she saw the violets still lying beside
her plate. She hesitated a moment,
then took them up and carried them to a
vase in the next room, but in the midst of
arranging them there she impulsively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
turned to a magazine near at hand,
slipped them into this, and then tucked
the book away, coloring the while like a
girl detected with her first love letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn't so dreadful what I did,&#8221; she
muttered, to reinstate herself. &#8220;It didn't
matter about the radishes, anyhow. They
were so old it would have been disrespectful
to eat them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she felt badly, nevertheless, as she
caught up her hat, which lay upon the
sofa just where she had thrown it the
night before, and started off to Constance
Chance's.</p>

<p>Something was stirred within her, and
she felt uneasy with a restlessness that inclined
her to seek a friend.</p>

<p>A friend! She had not one in the world.
Of all the women she knew, Constance
Chance claimed the most of her respect
and admiration, but Constance was
wholly unaware of this feeling, and
moreover, did not like Nannie. In old
days she tolerated her and was even attracted
by her beauty, but she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>warmly resented her marriage to Steve&mdash;whom
she regarded as deserving a wife
far superior to Nannie. She had, as is
the custom of women in such cases,
leaped to the conclusion that either Nannie
had made advances to Steve&mdash;which
he was too delicate and kind-hearted to
repel&mdash;or that she had in some way excited
his pity, and he had married her in
order to protect and care for her, and she
held it as a grudge against her. That a
man like Steve could be attracted by such
a girl as Nannie was inconceivable to
Constance, although Randolph regarded
the matter differently.</p>

<p>When she found that the marriage
really was to take place she resolved to
make the best of it, but it was not long before
she decided that Steve was unhappy,
and then her smouldering dissatisfaction
broke into such a lively flame that Randolph
was obliged to interpose to prevent
her from taking Nannie in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, sweetheart,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Don't get wrought up about it. I'm
afraid you'd only make matters worse.
Better let them rest as they are. We're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
not certain that it's so. Steve's a queer
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>know</i> he's unhappy!&#8221; Constance exclaimed.
&#8220;It's not necessary for him to
speak. There is a silence that is eloquent;
then his looks have changed. There's
something so pathetic about his whole
bearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I've noticed that. Poor old man!
Well, we can't help it. These aren't matters
for outsiders, my sweetheart&mdash;you
know that even better than I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, but I'm so angry with
that little minx! See how she has estranged
him from us. He hardly ever
comes here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I don't think that we ought
to put all the blame of that on Nannie.
A man isn't apt to run around after he's
married. Look at me&mdash;you can hardly
get me out at all, and I used to be a great
gad-about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say, sir, I dare say,&#8221; said Constance,
nodding her head as one who
knows.</p>

<p>Randolph laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly was over at your house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
often enough,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but now that
I've run the race and won the prize, I
can stay at home and enjoy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wish poor Steve had a home
to enjoy,&#8221; murmured Constance as a last
word.</p>

<p>As a matter of course this conversation
and the reflections which followed it did
not prepare Constance to give Nannie a
very cordial greeting when she came
over that day. Had she known Nannie's
state of mind; had she guessed that the
child-wife looked up to her and was so
ready to be influenced by her, the older
woman, she would have done altogether
differently. It is the lack of this very
knowledge that makes much of life a
mere blundering about in the dark.</p>

<p>She received her coolly, and Nannie
was sensitive enough to feel this so deeply
that Randolph's hearty welcome could
but partially heal the hurt. This pain,
however, was not without its resultant
benefit, although the lesson for which it
opened the way might have come more
gently. Stung to the quick, aching with
loneliness, and with a yearning which she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
did not understand, the young wife was
roused as never before and her eyes
opened to things heretofore unseen. She
noticed the orderliness of the home she
was in, its air of thrift and good management,
and its artistic beauty. Nor was
this all, for the best of a home is that
which is too elusive, too subtile to remain
under any of these heads, and this indefinite
something attracted and touched
Nannie to-day. Fog and mist, cloud and
rain had softened the soil into which these
seeds fell. Pain is a strong note in the
prelude to life.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Nannie's crude
resentful type of pride that she prolonged
her stay at Constance's, even though she
realized she was unwelcome. She would
not allow any one the satisfaction of seeing
that she felt hurt.</p>

<p>As far as possible, Randolph tried to
atone for his wife's lack of cordiality,
and in pursuance of this aim he made an
essential point of taking Nannie around
the little place and showing her the latest
arrivals in the vegetable line. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
considerable to show, for his tiny plantation
was a model of thrift and comeliness.
Many varieties of vegetables were holding
out their succulent wares, all ready
for table use, and many more were absorbing
sunshine and balmy air in preparation
for future calls. Near the house
cheery and fragrant flowers gladdened
the pretty beds in which no weed was allowed
to rear its vicious crest. There
was, it is true, one ugly, uncivilized portion
of the place, in which the primitive,
the barbaric reigned supreme. As yet
Randolph had not found time to attack
this spot and bring it within the pale of
garden orthodoxy. Secretly he had for a
time been hoping that Constance would
take it in hand, although he would have
been ashamed to let her know he dreamed
of this. Certainly he would have been
shocked at the idea of setting her at any
such task, but he would as certainly have
winked at her own voluntary performance
of it. To be entirely frank, he had
a little scene all ready in his imagination,
in which this unsightly corner was found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
clothed and in its right mind&mdash;the noxious
weeds having been cast out by Constance's
gentle hands. In this delightful
scene Constance always stood by smiling
in a deprecatory way, and he was always
gently upbraiding her&mdash;&#8220;Now, Constance!
Why, this is shameful! The idea
of your doing such a thing! It wasn't
right of you! You must promise me you
will never, never do anything of this sort
again!&#8221; and so forth, and so on.</p>

<p>But alas! this scene, like many another,
remained in the author's possession, Constance
giving no occasion to act it out, but
going circumspectly and quietly on her
way, ignorant of this delightful little
fancy of her husband's. Just now she
was busy, very busy, and very happy indoors.
She sat sewing in the cool, beautiful
library, and the house door was open.</p>

<p>When Randolph excused himself from
Nannie by-and-by to talk with a man who
called on business, the latter started
toward the house. On the gallery she
paused, for she heard Constance's voice
within, and she did not care to go to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
There was a hammock, shaded by a vine,
near at hand, and she crept into this, and
lying there the waves of Constance's low,
sweet voice, mingled with the perfume
of the honeysuckle, stole out to her and
stirred new longings. Nannie leaned
forward and caught a glimpse of Constance,
who was at work, doing some of
that fine sewing which gentlewomen love
to put upon things of sweet value. Nannie
could not discern what it was, but as Constance
shifted the contents of her work
basket a little article came in sight, and
all at once Nannie felt, as it were, an imprisoned
soul within her fluttering
against the bars of its cage.</p>

<p>Dickens tells of a character whose unworthy
life had apparently extinguished
the divine spark, and yet, down deep
within her, at the end of a tortuous passage,
there was a door, and over this door
was the word womanhood. Nannie had
such a door, and at sight of that tiny
article of clothing it opened. The girl's
heart&mdash;the woman's heart was crying out
now, and her eyes were dim with tears
she did not understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>All unconscious of the pathos of the
scene, Constance plied her dainty needle,
and in a sweet low voice talked with a
young girl (Gertrude Earnest) who sat
at her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;A story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, please, Mrs. Chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance, you must know, was a
story teller&mdash;not of a reprehensible
sort, but a legitimate, orthodox one, and
locally she was not without honor on
this account.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, long, long ago,&#8221; she began,
&#8220;in the dim dawn of creation, the
gods looked down upon man whom they
had made, and realized that he was but a
poor piece of work.</p>

<p>&#8220;'He needs other gifts,' said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;'Yea, verily,' murmured another, 'but
they are fraught with such peril!'</p>

<p>&#8220;'Nevertheless he must have at least
one more. He must not continue unconscious
even of what is taking place
around him&mdash;the acts of which he himself
is a part.'</p>

<p>&#8220;And so they sent a spirit whose eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
were large and somber, and mankind received
her with open arms, not knowing
that her name was Realization. Endowed
with this immortal gift, they no longer
groveled, for they knew what was passing
around them&mdash;knew what part they
were playing in the great drama, Life.
And when she turned her happy face
toward them they waxed merry, but when
they saw her sterner visage they wept.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still they lacked painfully, living as
they did wholly in the present, sending
never a backward glance along the echoing
corridors of the past&mdash;never a swift
shaft of sight along the dim shadowy
vistas of the future. And the gods noted
this lack.</p>

<p>&#8220;'It must be remedied,' said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;'Nay! nay!' pleaded another. 'Let
them be as they are. They are spared so
much of grief.'</p>

<p>&#8220;'They are also denied so much of
joy,' said the first with gentle firmness.
'They must receive their gift and must
pay its price.'</p>

<p>&#8220;'Ah the price! So heavy!' still
pleaded the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;'The end is worth the pain,' was the
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so another spirit was sent to
earth, and she too had a double aspect.
One face was lighted by a happy, dreamy
smile; the other was lined with sharpest
pain, for her name was Memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;'One more gift and the trio is complete,'
the gods decreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;'Let them alone; in mercy let them
alone!' pleaded the pitying spirit. 'They
have enough to bear&mdash;enough of joy;
enough of grief.'</p>

<p>&#8220;'Nay, nay. They are but imperfectly
endowed. They look about them at the
waves that lap the beach on which they
stand, and look backward o'er the sands
of Time, but send never a glance forward
over the great misty ocean of the Future.'</p>

<p>&#8220;Then down from the other world
there shot a gleam of golden light that
rested on a shadow, and willy-nilly&mdash;not
knowing, not caring, possibly resisting
had they fully comprehended&mdash;mankind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was endowed with another gift, and its
name was Anticipation. One face was
dazzling in its radiance&mdash;that they called
Hope; the other was deep with gloom,
and that was Dread. With the coming
of this gift the veil that hung athwart the
future was pierced, and mankind saw as
the gods see, not only what was, not alone
what had been, but what was to be as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;And on a day when all went fair they
clung to these three gifts&mdash;Realization,
Memory, and Anticipation&mdash;and thanked
the gracious gods, but on another day,
when Life pressed hard, they tried to
fling them off and cried in bitter reproach:
'Why didst thou burden us
with double-faced, tormenting creatures?
Why wore they not a single face, and that
a happy one?'</p>

<p>&#8220;Then down through the immeasurable
quivering ether that veils eternity came
the answering murmur, tender and pitiful
as a strain of music upon a broken
heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;'Thou canst not know&mdash;not yet&mdash;some
day; for &#8220;now we see through a
glass darkly, but then face to face.&#8221;'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the story was told Nannie
was weeping, for all at once she knew
where she stood&mdash;all at once looked backward
and saw what she had done; looked
forward and saw what was to come.</p>

<p>But betwixt herself and Constance
there was a high stone wall, called Misunderstanding,
and Constance did not
scale this wall, and so lost one of the
sweetest pleasures known to mortals&mdash;helping
a fellow-being out of the dark
into the light.</p>

<p>And Nannie hungered and went home
unfed.</p>



<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a well-known fact that many a
poor wretch has gone up to the very gate
of Paradise, only to bound back again,
as if either he himself or that bar to bliss
were made of India rubber. Nothing
could be more tantalizing or discouraging
to the spirit, unless, indeed, it were
the experience of many a despairing and
hoping convalescent who is bandied about
by the hand of fate with a shuttlecock
movement betwixt sickness and health.</p>

<p>Many of us feel good for an hour at a
time, several hours occasionally, but to be
good overnight&mdash;to waken in the morning
with one's resolutions and aspirations
as crisp and fresh as they were the evening
before&mdash;is proof positive of regeneration.</p>

<p>Once in a while it occurs to the rebellious
that things might have been made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
trifle easier. For instance, if only one
had to walk miles to meet the tempter, or
if only he had the decency and dignity
to demand that we meet him half way,
instead of coming all the way himself and
invading the privacy of our very homes.
If only he would wear his horns and tail
all the time, that we might know him on
sight and realize what we are about when
we go under, instead of slinking in
clothed as an angel of light. Not that
the Andersonvilles, as Nannie called the
mother and son Anderson, looked like
angels of light. On the contrary, they
were as ugly as the evil one, but they
were without horns or tails, and so not
easily recognizable as that particular and
very reprehensible person. And Nannie
was lured by them to let loose her spirit
of mischief.</p>

<p>We have mentioned neighbors once or
twice before. Now, the biblical definition
of neighbor covers a wide field, and
all experience will bear me out in an assertion,
that apart from numbers the
word stands for all sizes, shapes, and varieties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of human being. Nowadays most
of us whisper the term crazy, realizing
that we ourselves are liable to be caught
up and incarcerated under that head.
Nevertheless within ourselves we know
that some of those about us&mdash;and we
could point them out if we were asked&mdash;are
trying to pass off cracked brains for
sound ones.</p>

<p>Before Steve and Nannie had been
domiciled more than a fortnight in their
new abode, where they had fancied that
their living was to be of the best, a fly appeared
in the ointment, a fly which
directly proved to be out of its mind&mdash;in
other words, they discovered that they
had crazy neighbors. Let no one understand
me to signify by this the kind of
crazy person who seizes you by the hair
and brandishes his fist in your face, declaring
that your hour has come. That
is one variety, to be sure, an unpleasant
variety, too; but there are others. If it
came to a matter of weeding out all those
whose brains were slightly out of gear,
most of us could appear in court with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
batch of crazy neighbors, thereby depriving
a city of some of its principal men
and society of some of its chief ornaments.</p>

<p>No one would like to do this, but when
the crack in a neighbor's brains widens so
as to seriously upset his notions of other
people's rights, then he is bound to become
not dangerous necessarily, but certainly
troublesome, and some step must
be taken in self-defense.</p>

<p>As Steve learned too late, he stood
upon contested ground. The former
owner being now in the insane asylum,
and having, before she became unbalanced,
deeded the property to her husband
(who had subsequently sold it to
Steve), she was temporarily out of the
way, but it seemed that by some oversight
she had left outside a mother and
a brother, whom she should have taken
in with her.</p>

<p>These relatives, as far as Steve was
able to learn, never claimed that the
transfer of property to the husband was
invalid because the owner was at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
time insane. Their claim was that she
had not gone insane at all, and that she
had, in a manner, been forced into deeding
her property away, and consequently
the transaction was null and void and she
still owned it. A written document to
this effect was posted on one of the
largest trees near the house soon after
the newly wedded pair moved out there,
but Steve found upon investigation that
this was but one of many threads forming
a cobweb of prodigious size within the
brains of these peculiar folk whose relative
had outrun them to the asylum.
Consequently he was disposed to dismiss
the whole matter from his mind. Not
so the crazy neighbors, for they continued
to post the contested place with
notices, and Nannie became habituated to
plucking several of these legal <i>billets-doux</i>
from the trees every morning before
breakfast.</p>

<p>All this was great sport for Nannie,
but the trouble soon took a more serious
turn. The outcome of this latter was an
anonymous notification to Steve that if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
he failed to take down an obstruction
which he had put across one of the roads
on his place to prevent its being used as
a public thoroughfare, he would be
mobbed by a crowd of men and boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a most extraordinary condition
of affairs,&#8221; said Steve one day in talking
the matter over with Randolph
Chance, &#8220;to be racing around with dogs
and cutlasses when you're supposed to be
cooling your brow under your vine and
fig-tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if to add insult to injury, the Andersons,
mother and son, made a passageway
of the place they claimed (in the
name of their daughter and sister) and
persisted in using this, in spite of remonstrance
and even warning.</p>

<p>Now, for some time past Nannie had,
by means best known to women, been
contriving to fire Steve's usually placid
temper, and the morning after her visit
to Constance's an opportunity presented
itself for the fanning of the flames she
had kindled. On opening her door just
after breakfast she saw mother Anderson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and her son William land at the little
private pier Steve had built, and then
walk with a bold and rugged step up
toward the house <i>en route</i> to the station,
some half mile to the rear.</p>

<p>Now was Nannie's chance!</p>

<p>Such fun to see Steve fight!</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve!&#8221; she screamed, running into
the house, &#8220;here are those dreadful people
again! They frighten me to death!
I shall never dare to stay here alone if
you don't make an end of their coming!&#8221;
Frightened! Ah, Nannie! with that
bright color and those dancing eyes!</p>

<p>Steve ran out, his mind aflame at last
as he thought of poor little Nannie's terrors
and the offensive note he had received.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Anderson,&#8221; he began, &#8220;you
have been asked to keep away from this
place. It has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But just here William, who had no regard
for social amenities, cut his remarks
short by a resounding slap in the face.</p>

<p>Steve had never fought in his life. He
was rather ashamed of this (had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
confessed it), and the time seemed ripe
now to break his peace record. Drawing
back, to give himself a greater spring, he
landed a heavy blow somewhere in mid-air.
Said locality surviving the attack,
he withdrew to prepare a fresh onslaught.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he began to notice that he
was being smartly thumped by the enemy,
and he aimed a supreme effort in that
direction.</p>

<p>His blow was not the &#8220;immortal passado&#8221;
mentioned by Mercutio, but rather
the &#8220;punto reverso,&#8221; for it landed him in
the dust, while the enemy remained on
high.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture mother Anderson
put in her oar, literally as well as figuratively,
for happening to have that instrument
of navigation in her hand, she
proceeded to belabor the prostrate Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that!&#8221; screamed Nannie. &#8220;Oh,
you bad, fiendish woman! Sick her,
Brownie!&#8221;</p>

<p>And away went Brownie and attached
himself firmly to Madam Anderson's
train, and beginning a swift rotary movement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
so bewildered the old lady that she
lost both oar and enemy, and looked more
like a pirouette dancer than a decorous
upholder of the cause of individual freedom
and public highways.</p>

<p>By this time Steve had regained his
perpendicular, and tingling with mortification,
started in and really did some inspired
work. Taking the foe by the collar,
he shook him as a cat would shake
a rat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little puppy! Get out of here!&#8221;
he roared in a most unnatural voice.</p>

<p>Then with the oar (which mother
Anderson had abandoned when she took
to dancing) in one hand and the dangling
enemy in the other, he proceeded down
the slope, out upon the little pier, and
after sousing the refractory William in
the lake, dropped him into his boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you follow him, and be off&mdash;both
of you!&#8221; he said sternly to madam,
who stood upon the pier, squawking like
an old hen on the eve of decapitation.</p>

<p>She lost no time in obeying him, albeit
she continued to work nature's bellows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
with great vigor as Steve threw in the
oar he held and gave the boat an energetic
thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve, you're a trump!&#8221; cried Nannie.</p>

<p>Steve looked at her aghast.</p>

<p>Was this the timid little creature he
had been protecting? Evidently he was
as much at sea on the feminine question
as before marriage.</p>

<p>He walked slowly up to the house and
managed to recover his breath before he
was called for the next scene in this rural
drama. Truth to tell he was disgusted,
not because of the disgrace of a quarrel,
but&mdash;alas for mankind in even his gentlest
aspect!&mdash;because he had failed to get
a crack at the enemy.</p>

<p>That evening near dinner-time the plot
was thickened by the arrival of the
sheriff, who bore a warrant for the entire
Loveland family&mdash;dog included.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it hedn't been a new jestice she
cudn't hev got it out,&#8221; he said apologetically.
&#8220;She's arrested everybody in
sight agin and agin, includin' her own
fam'ly. You hev yer meal now an' then
come 'roun' over ter the jestice's office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly, after dinner Steve and
Nannie walked over to the village, and
after diligent search found the justice,
who informed them that he &#8220;did hev a
place fer ther trial, but they tuk it from
him fer a show an' he was a-huntin' fer
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>This other being finally discovered,
the criminals&mdash;Steve, Nannie and
Brownie&mdash;were brought in, and William
Anderson, being duly sworn, was perched
up in an aged arm-chair and encouraged
to unfold his tale of woe to a crowded
house, for the room was full, and even the
doors and windows were blocked by the
heads of on-lookers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about eight o'clock in the
morning,&#8221; William began in a high,
cracked voice&mdash;possibly his neck was still
dislocated. &#8220;My mother and myself were
on our way to meet some friends whom
we expected on the next train. Landing
at the pier, we proceeded up toward the
cottage now fraudulently occupied by
these people.&#8221; (Here he pointed impressively
at the wicked ones, whereupon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Brownie, who resented this, barked
fiercely and was promptly smothered by
the Court.) &#8220;Rounding a corner we encountered
this man&#8221; (another indication
with that powerful index finger), &#8220;who
immediately fell upon me with great fe-roc-i-ty.
First he struck me mightily
here&mdash;then he gave me a terrific blow
here&mdash;then one of unparalleled strength
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Steve was bridling up and
looking like a conquering hero. He really
had hit the man! It was the first time
he or any one else had known it.</p>

<p>&#8220;He then struck me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; William
continued, but the Court interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here. You've already had
enough to kill ten men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's what I was about to say, your
honor, and I will not harrow your honor's
feelings by telling more of his awful
assault. Seeing that I was suffering in
this manner, my mother approached with
an oar, when she&mdash;her&#8221; (indicating Nannie
by pointing fixedly and by a stony
glare) &#8220;rushed upon her fiercely and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
caused her dog also to charge upon her,
which he did so savagely as to decompose
her raiment. In some way the oar
flew out of her hand, and she was most
disrespectfully whirled around and
around, so that she is yet dizzy-headed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here madam put her hand to her brow
in confirmation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was then taken by the scruff of the
neck down to the pier, and whether I
fell in the lake or not I cannot say, but I
was wet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the on-lookers shouted with
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother was then disrespectfully
helped in and we were sent adrift.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ended in a high-toned, pitiful
whine suggestive of a dog's song on a
moonlight night, but this plaint was
drowned in the roars of laughter raised
by the audience.</p>

<p>Madam Anderson confirmed and embellished
this tale, but Steve's and Nannie's
narrative, giving the circumstances
of the case, their purchase of the place,
the annoyances to which these people had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
subjected them, the warning that had
been sounded to keep them at arm's
length, and the continued disregard of
all this, sufficed, in the opinion of the
Court, to acquit them and fix the burden
of the expenses entailed by the suit
upon the Anderson shoulders.</p>

<p>One would have supposed that this
episode would have satisfied Nannie for
awhile, but she was tireless, and must
needs start out to sit hens soon after the
Andersons were laid low. Now, of all
unreasoning, stupid, obstinate, contrary
beasts, a sitting hen is well qualified to
carry off the first prize. Nannie had been
told that when a hen began to puff up
her feathers until she was swollen to
about three times her natural size, and
make a noise that sounded as if she had
tried to say something and the word
caught on a hook in her throat, she was
ready to sit. Having three feathered animals
in this condition, and having coaxed
Steve into buying some Plymouth Rock
eggs at the trivial sum of three dollars a
sitting, Nannie proceeded to capture the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
hens and put them upon nests of her own
placing, wholly ignorant of the fact that
if there is one thing above all others in
which a hen must have her say, it was in
the choice of residence during this vexatious
period. From the moment that
Nannie put the hens upon the eggs she
led a life of unexampled activity. No
sooner would she turn her back than the
various madams would rise, and with distended
feathers and gurgling clucks dismount
from the nests and begin to stalk
around the yard, in defiance of directions
to the contrary. The number of times
that Steve was pushed under one side of
the house in pursuit of the escaped&mdash;lunatic,
I had almost said, and told to remain
there while Nannie ran around and
crawled under the other side to head her
off, would pass belief. As a matter of
course she was never caught by this
double-barreled attack, but always
stalked out from some unexpected crevice
and promenaded the yard as if she owned
the premises. The next move on Steve's
and Nannie's part would be to drive her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
nestward. The result of this was always
to land her in some place precisely opposite;
for the moment she was headed
properly she would tilt her wings and
break into a fat, wheezy little run in the
direction just contrary to the one indicated
by common sense and lawful
authority.</p>

<p>One day, after an hour of this sport,
Nannie lost patience, and picking up
stones, pelted the feathered truant until
she fled out of sight&mdash;in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her eggs cool!&#8221; she exclaimed
with a burst of passionate tears. &#8220;I don't
care if they get as cold as an iceberg! I
wish they'd freeze her stiff the next time
she sits on them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve began a mild protest, but Nannie
turned to walk into the house, when she
caught sight of Madam Hen No. 2 off
her nest and stalking around with the
same offensive strut as that of No. 1.</p>

<p>This was too much for her own nervous
system, and she rushed upon the
offending hen, and kept up this pace with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
such vigor that at the end of ten minutes
she had run her down, taken her literally
in hand, borne her squawking into
the barn, jammed her down on the nest,
and roofed it with boards, which she
nailed on with rocks. This done, she returned
to the house in a state of savage
quiet (if I may be allowed a contradictory
term), feeling herself fiercely secure
of at least one sitting.</p>

<p>She was not, however, for madam
spared no effort till she burst her bonds,
brought the rocks down upon the heads
of herself and her prospective family, and
they all died the death together.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's some satisfaction in that,&#8221;
said Nannie. &#8220;The stupid, nasty, mean
old thing went with the eggs!&#8221;</p>

<p>The third sitting materialized, and a
lovelier brood of chicks was never seen.
Steve was surprised and even touched as
he stood watching Nannie in her delight.
There was something really womanly in
the way in which the girl coddled the
pretty creatures, holding them close to
her face and calling them all the sweet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
tender little names in which a woman's
heart goes out to the infantile and the
helpless.</p>

<p>Looking and thinking, several things
came into Steve's mind, and one evening
he essayed to bring about a better understanding
betwixt his erratic little wife
and himself. But alas! though possessed
of an unusually tender heart and of unusually
fine intuitions, yet occasionally
Steve was a man, pure and simple, and
this was one of the occasions. Just as
Nannie was sitting down to dinner he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie, I've been wondering what is
it that makes you act so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't act!&#8221; stormed Nannie, who
was ablaze in a minute. &#8220;It's you who
act! You treat me as if I were a two-year-old
child!&#8221; Then, in a gust of
changed emotion, she took a step nearer
to him and cried out:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't want to be bad, but&#8221;&mdash;she
turned now toward the door, and as she
went out looked backward over her
shoulder and added impishly&mdash;&#8220;I am,
and I'm 'fraid I'm going to be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And off she went&mdash;off to the barn, and
the next moment there was a lonely,
yearning child-wife sobbing her heart out
on Sarah Maria's neck.</p>

<p>Evidently there was a bond between
these two, for Nannie was neither hooked
nor kicked, and when Sarah Maria behaved
peacefully at both ends it was manifest
that her heart was touched.</p>



<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span> returned from town the evening
following Nannie's outburst with a mind
heavy laden. That had been his mental
condition, indeed, much of the time since
he turned farmer, and I may add that his
thoughts occasionally ran in a sarcastic
vein&mdash;a course ordinarily foreign to him.
Shortly before that crucial point in his
career, his marriage to Nannie, Randolph
Chance had loaned him a beautiful idyl,
termed &#8220;Liberty and a Living.&#8221; Randolph
himself had read this as a thirsty
man reads of cool, rock-paved brooks;
Steve read it as a poet, a dreamer, but it
would no doubt have had a marked effect
upon his character had he not closely followed
it up with Charles Dudley Warner's
&#8220;Summer in a Garden,&#8221; much as
one would chase a poison with its antidote,
only in this case the order was reversed,
the latter resembling the poison,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
since it awoke in his mind gloomy forebodings
and inspired satirical reflections
upon the universal mother.</p>

<p>Tuned to this key, he was no doubt
ill-prepared, while turning the clod, to receive
into his soul the sweet influences of
rural life, and by reason of their elevating
beauty, to be fortified against those
drawbacks and trials with which all paths
abound.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, Steve was discouraged.
He had begun to realize that he had on
his hands not only a small farm, for the
tillage of which he was ill-contrived, but
a large child as well, whose rearing and
developing&mdash;&mdash; Just here he came to
a sudden halt in his thought, and an
odd word leaped in:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cooking!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the name of that newspaper clipping
of which Randolph once told him&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How to Cook Wives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how in thunder?&#8221; he asked
himself, and walked homeward from the
station.</p>

<p>Ere he arrived he saw Nannie at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
door. She was screaming something
which, on his approach, he found to be&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sarah Maria is lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>Had Steve said &#8220;thank Heaven!&#8221; he
would merely have been speaking out of
the fullness of his heart. Instead of
that, he wheeled like an automaton and
retraced his steps. He knew where to
look for her.</p>

<p>There she was, as usual, down near the
track, and as Steve approached she
stepped squarely on, and with a set gaze
awaited the speedy coming of the city-bound
train. Of course she knew it
would kill her, but like Samson of old
she would have the satisfaction of taking
a few acquaintances with her.</p>

<p>Steve dragged her off and managed to
get her home, and thus for the present
prevented the sin of self-destruction.</p>

<p>That very evening, after Nannie, like the
cow, was corralled (and we may use this
term without reproach, since she had been
rampant all day), a small figure slipped
from out the house and hastened to the
garden. His little face, frowsy as is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
manner of his breed, was uplifted, and
his saucy little eyes gleamed with fire.
He had probably observed that the peas
were flourishing and that they were the
one living result of Steve's heroic labors,
unless perhaps we except the corn, which
was still several miles distant from fruitage.
No doubt all this was clear to
Brownie, and that was why he took such
fiendish delight in his work of demolition.
The naughty little eyes twinkled;
the naughty little mouth opened to emit
his short-breathed pants; and the naughty
little tongue hung out as he pranced and
leaped, rolled and gamboled over the
cast-down and dejected peas. Finally he
chewed and tore the fragments that remained,
and then gave himself a shake&mdash;by
no means so severe as he deserved&mdash;and
strutted into the house with a
&#8220;They're-done-for!&#8221; air, quite exasperating
to witness when one considered how
the poor peas were lying out there prone
upon their faces in the dust, crushed to
earth, unlike truth, to rise no more.</p>

<p>The next morning, all unconscious of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the ruin of his crop, Steve was deliberately
making his toilet, when he was
startled by roars of fright. Looking
from the window, he perceived a neighbor
flying down the road, with Sarah
Maria in his wake. The latter had
lowered her head&mdash;not in shame, I grieve
to say, but with malicious intent, as was
abundantly evidenced by the height of
her tail.</p>

<p>Happily Nannie had seen this procession
of two as it passed the house, and
giving chase with swift steps, had caught
Sarah Maria's long rope and wound it
several times around a large tree, thus
checking her mad career and saving a
worthy citizen for the republic.</p>

<p>The excitement attendant upon all this
was very great, especially as the neighbor
was for a time firmly resolved to bring
action, not being satisfied with the action
Sarah Maria had brought, but by dint
of much persuasion, both from Steve and
also from Randolph Chance, who came to
the rescue, he was at length called off,
and Steve was so relieved that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
able to note the destruction of his peas
with scarce a ripple of emotion.</p>

<p>The calm of the succeeding twenty-four
hours was but that which precedes the
storm, and the glassy placidity of Steve's
life for that one day proved to be the deceitful
stillness of deep waters. Upon his
return from the city he was again greeted
with the welcome intelligence that Sarah
Maria had raised her head, adjusted her
hind legs, whose hinges, owing to much
kicking, had been reversed of late, and
betaken herself to parts unknown. Worn
out as he was with the events of the past
week, Steve was unequal to a discreet
concealment of his feelings, and the satisfaction
he evinced in Nannie's news was
stoutly resented by that singular young
person. Indeed, she became so wrought
up&mdash;crying, upbraiding, and lamenting&mdash;that
Steve was obliged to console her by
promising to advertise the errant beast
if she were not found at her usual trysting-place&mdash;the
railroad track. This he
did, repeating the dose daily for a week,
at the end of which time he received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
word that Sarah Maria had temporarily
located herself on a farm some forty
miles inland. Not being well disposed to
a walk of that length, enlivened by Sarah
Maria's society, Steve sent word to forward
the lady by freight.</p>

<p>Owing to some mistake her car was
switched off about ten miles from the
proper station, and thinking that he could
bridge that distance, Steve set out on a
train early the next evening, and soon
found himself in reach of the missing
member of his household. She was looking
out of the freight car when he arrived,
and he noted with a secret qualm
that she shook her head disapprovingly
when she saw him.</p>

<p>Steve stood and gazed at her for so
long that the man in charge there finally
asked him what he was waiting for.
Steve replied that she looked so happy it
seemed a pity to disturb her. The man
said that he didn't regard her as particularly
happy, inasmuch as she had all but
kicked out one side of the car. Upon
hearing which, Steve hastened to assure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
him that that was merely a playful way
of hers when her spirits were at the highest,
but the man said that her spirits were
several feet too high for him, and he insisted
upon lowering them to <i>terra firma</i>.
He was so firm and so disagreeable about
this that Steve was obliged to advance
and join him in the difficult undertaking.</p>

<p>It might seem reasonable to expect that
as long as Sarah Maria had testified vigorously
to her disapproval of the freight
car she would be glad to issue from it,
and no doubt that would have been the
case had Steve and the station master
urged her to remain. The moment, however,
that she saw with her eagle eye that
they were making preparations for her
ejectment, her mind was made up, and
she spread her four feet in a manner suggestive
of rocks that refuse to fly.</p>

<p>The unhappy men now united their efforts
at pulling, but her roots had evidently
gone down to China without stopping;
next they endeavored to pry her
up, but she was manifestly stuck by some
glue of unparalleled strength.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the honest sweat was dripping
from the brows of both men; Sarah
Maria alone was calm. Various devices
were used to dislodge her, and at the end
of an hour she had moved a trifle further
than a glacier does in a similar length of
time, and was fully as cold and calm as
this natural phenomenon. As she was
quite near the opening of the car when
she took her stand, in a physical as well
as in a moral sense, even the very slight
advantage gained by her enemies sufficed
to put her in position to make her final
exit when, like Sairy Gamp, she was &#8220;so
dispodged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the station master, who
by this time had not so much as a dry
thread on him, &#8220;if you'll pull I'll twist
her tail so's to divert her attention, and
I guess we'll make a go of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve looked into the threatening eye
of Sarah Maria, and foreseeing his doom
if he stood in front of her, told the station
master that as Sarah, for some
reason, seemed disinclined to love him,
she might be unwilling to go in his direction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and for that reason he would better
keep out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if you will kindly
pull I will kindly twist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve was always polite, and never
more so than when excited.</p>

<p>The suggestion appealed to the innocent
station master, who saw no hidden
intent in Steve's retreat, and the change
of position having been effected, the two
men went to work.</p>

<p>For a time Steve twisted gently, but
firmly, while the station master tugged
and jerked, but still none of these things
moved her.</p>

<p>All at once there was a transformation
scene, and it came about as suddenly as
a flash of lightning from out a clear sky.
The participants never could give a clear
and harmonious account of what happened,
and all that an idle on-looker
could tell was that while he was gazing
he suddenly heard something strike the
roof of the car; in another instant he had,
after the occasional custom of nations,
recognized the belligerency of Sarah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Maria. When the din of battle had subsided
he beheld Steve arising from the
earth somewhere in the rear of the car,
while the station master, on all fours,
was in the act of picking himself up from
a spot just in front of where Sarah had
lately made her heroic stand.</p>

<p>Steve was in no wise perturbed or even
surprised. He realized that the bovine
belonged to the gentle sex, and anything
was to be expected. As long as Sarah
Maria and his wife spared his life, he felt
that he had no just cause for complaint;
both ladies were erratic, and he must simply
look for whatever happened.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as Steve regarded it,
Sarah Maria had not taken her departure,
her long rope having caught around a
tree and detained her. She was well out
of the car, however, and the station master
washed his hands of her.</p>

<p>It was by this time nearing dusk, and
Steve set out on his long walk toward
home with many misgivings. Under
happy circumstances a walk in the country
along the brookside, through meadows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and woods in the evening is quieting,
but Steve found it the reverse of this to-night.
Not that he had no still moments,
in which the brain might work and
memory hold sway; there were such, indeed,
at first, for Sarah Maria set out
with him so gently and quietly that the
station master concluded she must be one
of those feminines who wax irritable
when their way of life is disturbed, and
that once relieved of the box-car she
would proceed as a domestic animal
should.</p>

<p>Even Steve began to entertain hopes
of her reformation, but these were soon
dashed to the ground, and he went with
them. He arose (he had by this time become
an expert at arising), and again
there was a truce, which he gratefully
accepted, for he was ready enough to
enjoy peace while it lasted.</p>

<p>Walking by a brook which skirted a
little farm, his mind was busy with reflections.
Heretofore he had looked at
these places and seen them in the gross,
as it were; now no detail escaped him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
He saw to-night that the weeds were
rampant among the peas and that in the
next bed the onions were drooping, evidently
having been trampled upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it,&#8221; he argued gently to himself,
&#8220;vicious things flourish in the face
of every discouragement, while it requires
so much coaxing and care to keep good
and useful articles above ground? One
might jump up and down on a weed continuously
every day for a month, and
the moment his back was turned it would
be up again, whereas once stepping on
a young blade of corn or the first shoots
of an onion is the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he looked at Sarah Maria and
bethought him how she never had a sick
day since they owned her, while a tractable,
useful cow would have died half a
dozen times over in this period, of pneumonia
or consumption.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>He might have answered this question
and thus solved a problem that has been
perplexing humanity ever since Adam
and Eve were told to go, but Sarah Maria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
preferred her own movements to those of
the intellect, and realizing that it was
growing late, she set off on a hard run
for home.</p>

<p>Now Steve had never in his college
days, ranked as an athlete, but as he flew
over the ground that night, with the long
rope that bridged the difference betwixt
himself and Sarah Maria quite taut, he
had an injured feeling, as of one to
whom injustice had been done. Not even
the champion runner had ever made such
time.</p>

<p>The violence of his gait would have
proved exhaustive had it been too long
continued, but Sarah Maria was merciful,
and ere long Steve came upon her standing
in her box-car attitude. She loosened
up by-and-by and again started toward
home with the speed of a race-horse, but
this time Steve was in front, and could
his friends have seen how well he kept
in front they would have covered him
with adulation.</p>

<p>Before long the rope was taut once more,
and Steve's sense of security was in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
marked and delightful contrast to his
feelings when it slackened that he told
Sarah Maria repeatedly to take her time&mdash;he
was in no hurry whatever. Neither
was Sarah, apparently, for between balking
and running, and capering about in
a truly extraordinary manner she passed
the better portion of the night. Finally,
in despair, Steve laid the case before her
and asked if she would look at the matter
dispassionately and consider the lateness
of the hour and their distance from
the domestic roof&mdash;would she, he urged,
keep this great central truth in sight?</p>

<p>She said that she would not, and she
said it so rudely that Steve felt hurt.
When he had gotten up and given himself
a good rubbing, he found that Sarah
Maria, like some little angel, had gone
before, and he hobbled after her as fast
as his bruises would permit.</p>

<p>They reached home at last, and a late
moon glowered down at them with calm
severity. Truth to tell, both Steve and
Sarah looked as if they had been on a
spree, and both were callous as to appearances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Their one idea was to part
company as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Out of respect to the Society for the
Prevention, and so forth, Steve decided
to give his interesting companion a drink;
then he would have done with her forever.
Having secured her to a near tree,
he approached the pump, pail in hand.</p>

<p>But Sarah Maria was watching him
narrowly, and as she looked there rankled
in her seemingly quiet breast the
memory of her wrongs. There was still
a twist in her tail, left over from the box-car,
and several kinks in her temper, and
influenced by these she approached Steve
just as he bent to lift the pail, and slipping
her horns under him, dexterously
lifted him from the ground and sent him
crashing through the nearest window,
which chanced to be that of his chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of mercy!&#8221; screamed
Nannie, starting up from her sleep in the
next room, &#8220;what is happening now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm coming to bed,&#8221; said Steve.</p>



<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span> was so used up by his rural experiences
that he could scarcely get out of
bed the next day. And that was not the
worst of it: his temper was bruised as
well as his body, as was manifest by the
way he behaved. Not that he stormed or
sulked; Steve was above anything of
this kind; but he did speak very decidedly,
for him, as he rose from his late breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you may do as you
wish about the cow. I think it might be
well to sell her for beef&mdash;she is in good
condition. But do as you wish about
that&mdash;she is yours; but I really cannot
undertake to have anything more to do
with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some time after Steve left the
house Nannie sat staring in the direction
in which he had disappeared. She was
as much amazed as she had been the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
he fought the Andersonvilles, but less
elated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said to herself at last, &#8220;the
upshot of it all is, he's given Sarah
Maria notice. I wonder if he will give
me notice next?&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked slowly into the kitchen,
where a stout, red-faced woman was at
work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bridget,&#8221; she said, &#8220;can you milk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure I kin; an' why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Mr. Loveland won't milk
Sarah Maria any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more wud I, an' he's stud it so
long. Shure he's been loike a lamb beside
her, an' she hookin' him full o' holes
till his poor body cud be used for a sieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what shall I do!&#8221; cried Nannie
pettishly. &#8220;You're all of you as mean as
you can be! I won't sell her for beef!
I just won't!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more you needn't, me darlint!
There, now, don't take on so. Shure it's
mesilf'll manage it wid yez somehow,
though it's loike the both of us will nade
the praste an' extrame unction before
we're t'rough wid her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing daunted Nannie sallied forth,
followed by Bridget, who grumbled all
the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, in ould Oireland it's mesilf
milked twinty cows at wan sittin', an'
they standin' forninst me widout a word
loike lambs till I was ready fer the nixt
wan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, that's great!&#8221; interrupted
Nannie. &#8220;Steve has left her right out
here. I wonder why he did that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Maria stared fixedly at her, once
in awhile tossing her horns. There was
a glare in her eye, by the light of which
one might read her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just here,&#8221; she was saying to herself,
&#8220;Steve and I fought to a finish, and I
saw the last of him as he flew through
yonder window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Set a pail of food forninst her now,
Miss Nannie, an' she'll run to the cow-yard,&#8221;
called Bridget.</p>

<p>This ruse proved successful. As soon
as she saw the food the delighted Sarah
kicked up her heels and, flourishing her
head in such a manner that it seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
comprehend everything in its wide swath,
ran into the cow-yard, where Nannie
skillfully lassoed her and tied her to the
fence just as she plunged her nose into
the pail.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bridget, terrified by these
lively humors, had started toward the
house, and her desire for speed exceeding
her physical ability, she soon measured
her length upon the ground, where she
lay, roaring lustily, under the impression
that the enemy was upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you howling for, you old
goose?&#8221; shouted Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's the cow!&#8221; screamed Bridget.
&#8220;Take her off! Oh, howly Mither! I'm
kilt entirely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cow is half a mile from you!&#8221;
laughed Nannie. &#8220;She didn't even look
toward you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure I felt her horns go into me
back, an' as the saints live in glory, I
see thim come out at me brist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wish I could see you come out
at the cow-yard with that milk pail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bridget picked up her pieces, put herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
together, and discontentedly ambled
toward the cow-yard, averring that in
spite of all Nannie might say, she knew
she had a hole an inch wide in her left
lung; she could feel the wind whistle
through it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's nothing the matter with your
lungs,&#8221; said Nannie, &#8220;as all the neighborhood
knows by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a long, solemn countenance and
a tear in each eye, Bridget approached
Sarah Maria, who was breakfasting in a
hasty, unhygienic manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's me life I take in me hand,&#8221; murmured
Bridget.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop your life and take your pail instead,
or are you going to milk into your
apron?&#8221; said Nannie imperiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, me pail! Shure the head of me is
turned intirely, bad cess to that cow! or
I believe there's a hole through it, loike
there is in me lung.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your head turned!&#8221; said Nannie
scornfully. &#8220;I should say it was&mdash;turned
inside out and emptied entirely.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bridget was wooing Mrs. Maria
now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Aisy, now! Aisy, I say!&#8221; she muttered
as she cautiously lowered herself
onto the milking stool.</p>

<p>But by some mysterious law of opposites,
as she went down the pail went up.
Sarah Maria never ceased munching for
a moment, but Nannie, who was fixedly
regarding her and trying to calculate how
much longer her breakfast would last,
heard the crash, and looking around saw
the pail on its way upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now may the saints forgive me if I
imperil me life anny longer!&#8221; cried Bridget
from a safe distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;And may Sarah Maria forgive you
for sitting down on the wrong side of
her, you old goose!&#8221; screamed Nannie in
her rude way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howly Mither defind us! Did I do
that now? Shure the twinty cows I
milked in ould Oireland preferred that
side, an' they were very particular about
it, ivery last wan of thim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don't crawl along that way,&#8221;
said Nannie impatiently as Bridget crept
up to her, &#8220;and take hold as if you
weren't afraid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure if I had a shillalah wid a sucker
on the ind of it, it's milk her I wud, widout
anny loss of me color, though she
thritened me wid twinty horns an' as
manny hind legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you've got several bees in your
bonnet, that's what's the matter with
you!&#8221; exclaimed Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it bees, ye say? Air they loose
too?&#8221; screamed Bridget, jerking off her
sunbonnet and tearing down her hair.
&#8220;Is it bees as well as cows in me hid, an'
ye standin' laffin loike ter kill yersilf at
the very idee of me bein' murdered in
cold blud!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time her hair was distraught
and her face flaming with excitement and
exertion, and altogether she so closely
resembled some avenging spirit that even
Sarah Maria began to tremble before her.</p>

<p>As soon as Nannie could control herself
she informed her that the terrifying
words she used were merely a figure of
speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clothed or not clothed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Nannie
began, but Bridget burst forth:</p>

<p>&#8220;An' I wuldn't hev belaved that anny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
young leddy wid a dacent raisin' wud use
figgers of spache, widout clothes at that.
It's Bridget O'Flannigan'll see if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here Nannie's screams of laughter
interrupted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you've a brick in your bonnet
as well as a bee,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>This time Bridget understood, and
clapping her sunbonnet (upside down)
onto her disrumpled head, she wabbled
toward the house.</p>

<p>This would never do, so Nannie ran
and planted herself in front of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, now, Bridget&mdash;dear Bridget,
don't be mad with me,&#8221; she said coaxingly.</p>

<p>Bridget had come to Mrs. Lamont's
when Nannie was little more than eight
years of age, and through the succeeding
years of childhood and girlhood had been
her stanch friend and her confidante in
many a time of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do with my cow? You
surely will help me out!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire faded from Bridget's flaming
countenance, and she paused, irresolute
as to her course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You won't desert me, Bridget, I
know!&#8221; pleaded Nannie softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it's not Bridget O'Flannigan
will desart an orphin child; but I make it
distinct, an' ye hear me now, that I'm a
respictable woman, not given to takin'
a dhrop too much or too little, an'
I won't stan' an' be insulted, an' me
twilve years over from ould Oireland
come Saint Patrick's Day. An' even if
I am doin' disrespictful work now, milkin'
an ould cow in which the divil has
taken up his risidince, I want yez still ter
handle me character wid care.&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt Sarah Maria was awed by
this address, or else the very uncomplimentary
manner in which she herself was
alluded to startled her into a realization
of the steep down which she was rushing
and toward what pit her path inclined.
Be that as it may, she contentedly
munched the second pail of food which
Nannie brought her, and granted the
trembling Bridget peace and quiet in
which to extract the cream and invoke
the saints.</p>



<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after the milking ordeal was at
an end Nannie started over to the house
of her cousins, the Misfits. It chanced
that she happened upon this ill-mated
couple in the nick of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, Nan,&#8221; exclaimed
Mr. Misfit. &#8220;I have a day off, and Mrs.
Misfit wants to take the boat trip. You
must go with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we've never been, and I told
Henry we really ought to go! I am tired
of being asked if I don't think it's pleasant,
and having to say I don't know anything
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You'll have to fly around and get
ready, then, for we must take the next
train in if we want to catch that boat.
You'll go,&#8221; he added as his wife slipped
away to dress, &#8220;won't you, Nannie?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie stood regarding him with one
of her elfin looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need me, don't you?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He laughed rather awkwardly. He
always felt uncomfortable when Nannie
looked at him that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, of course. We shall be
glad of your company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know why you wanted me to-day,&#8221;
said Nannie later on, when she was sitting
out on the deck of the boat with him
while Mrs. Misfit was taking a nap in
the saloon.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her, and saw
it would be of no use to try to evade.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's something uncanny about
this girl,&#8221; he said to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wanted me&mdash;you and Lillie both
wanted me to stand between you. You
couldn't endure each other's company
for a day. It would bore you to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;It
would bore me. I don't know about Lillie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can tell you,&#8221; said Nannie,
speaking in no uncertain tone. &#8220;You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
are just as uninteresting to her as she is
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are complimentary, I must say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about it. It's something
like this with Steve and me. We don't
bore each other, but we don't know what
to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what are you going to do about
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie sat silent for a moment. Evidently
she was revolving matters mentally.
Finally she turned to her companion,
and with a roguish smile, which
shone like a sunbeam out from overhanging
curls, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I'll have to 'perk up' a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't speak Hindoostanee,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Steve's above me, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded, but Nannie took no offense.
He was thinking. &#8220;That's our
trouble. I'm above Lillie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I must try to reach him somehow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Lillie would do that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began,
but Nannie cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not Lillie, it's <i>you</i>! Lillie is
above you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he caught his breath, this time
with a gasp, but he was forced to be
silent. It would be a strange man indeed
who could enter into an argument
to prove his wife inferior to himself. He
might be thoroughly convinced of this;
might even have taken it for granted that
others realized the fact, but he could
hardly have the face to bring his voluminous
arguments on this point to the attention
of an outsider.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you're thinking,&#8221; said
Nannie, and she looked uncanny again.
&#8220;I can't say these things as well as some
people could, but you think because you
know books you're better than Lillie.
The books can't be the first things, because
there must always be men before
there can be books; and there must always
be some real things, true things, before
there can be men. These were there
first. The books don't make them, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
just refer to them, and the people that
have the real things are higher than the
books. That's what makes Lillie higher
than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man sat thinking for a few moments,
then he tried to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Nannie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if one were
ill with that horrid disease called Conceit,
a quiet half hour with you on the deck of
a boat would restore him to health.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie gazed at him defiantly, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I'll tell you, little one, how it all
came about,&#8221; he said rather patronizingly.
&#8220;Lillie and I married when we were
boy and girl. She was seventeen and I
was twenty. Lillie was very pretty and
that attracted me, and I&mdash;well, I don't
know just what she saw in me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I've often wondered,&#8221; said Nannie.</p>

<p>He gave one look of blank amazement
and then dropped his hands in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you were more interesting
then than you are now,&#8221; Nannie
went on comfortingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; he said humbly, &#8220;but we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
neither of us knew the other. Our tastes
were not formed; our characters were not
matured. I grew one way, she grew
another; now we care for entirely different
things, and as a result we are walking
through life together and each is utterly
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking off over the big lake
now. He had forgotten the annoyances
and unpleasant surprises of their conversation.
He no longer saw Nannie. A
dreary never-ending waste was all that
held his mental vision.</p>

<p>Nannie's voice recalled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's no excuse,&#8221; she insisted.</p>

<p>He started like a man rudely awakened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who thought of making excuses?&#8221; he
said rather gruffly.</p>

<p>But down in his heart lay the testimony
that convicted him. By this it was
proven that he had for thirteen years been
excusing himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would take an interest you
could do something for Lillie and she
could do something for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not jest this away. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
taking an interest now and doing some
humiliating thinking, and as a result of
all this he stood before himself in a clear,
new light, in which it could readily be
seen that he was less in need of sympathy
than of pardon.</p>

<p>On her way home that afternoon Nannie
called at Mrs. Earnest's house, and
was boisterously welcomed by the two little
ones of the family, Mamie and Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;A story! A story!&#8221; they shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can't,&#8221; said Nannie. &#8220;I haven't
any in my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you must! You promised!&#8221;
urged Jim in an extremely moral tone
(he himself was a shocking transgressor
in the matter of promises). &#8220;You promised!
You know you did! You've got
to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what shall it be about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indians!&#8221; screamed Jim, &#8220;and let
them do a lot of killing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I want a kitty story,&#8221; said
Mamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won't have a kitty story&mdash;I want a
bloody Indian story!&#8221; said Jim stoutly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know any bloody Indian story,
and I wouldn't tell one if I did,&#8221; said
Nannie in her abrupt, decisive way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won't listen, then,&#8221; pouted Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. You may go to Kamchatka
if you like. Mamie and I are going
to have a kitty story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mamie cuddled up to Nannie, while
Master Jim stalked out of the room. It
was observed, however, that he was not
above taking up a squatter's claim in the
hall and listening through the crack of
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once upon a time,&#8221; Nannie began in
the old way so fascinating to children&mdash;&#8220;once
upon a time there lived a dear little
kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at this point the front door opened
and Mr. Earnest walked in. Now, Nannie
had never fancied this gentleman,
and to-night, as she noted his glowering
look, she felt a savage desire to annoy
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, chick,&#8221; he said, brusquely In
answer to little Mamie's greeting. &#8220;Good-evening,
Nannie,&#8221; he added, taking out
his paper and seating himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>As he did so Mrs. Earnest came into
the room. She always seemed ill at ease
in her husband's presence, though she
strove to appear the contrary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, good-evening, dear,&#8221; she began.
&#8220;Are you home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I'm not,&#8221; he said roughly. &#8220;Can't
you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I recognized you,&#8221; she replied,
forcing a little laugh.</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you bring the sugar, dear?&#8221; she
asked presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn't.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was depending on this for preserving,
and she wanted to ask why he
failed, but did not quite dare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you bring it to-morrow?&#8221; she
inquired after an awkward pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; he said gruffly.</p>

<p>Again she hesitated. She was very
gentle and naturally timid, and his treatment
had increased the latter tendency.
At last she mustered strength to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;I need it very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reply, and directly she
left the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, not one iota of this domestic
scene was lost upon Nannie. From the
day she had listened to that story told by
Constance Chance to her young friend
(Mrs. Earnest's oldest child) she had
been looking about her sharply. The first
direction of eyes newly opened is outward.
We see our neighbors&mdash;see that
instead of performing their part like men
they are skulking through life&mdash;men as
churls, snarling, or it may be stalking,
automaton fashion; men as sticks, walking,
and we hasten to correct their errors.
Our own correction comes afterward, if
at all, for as the poet has told us, it were
easier to tell twenty what were good to be
done than to be one of the twenty to do it.</p>

<p>Nannie fastened her eyes upon Mr.
Earnest, but as he was now absorbed in
his paper he lost the benefit of her fierce
glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don't you tell?&#8221; urged Mamie,
who did not relish this interruption to her
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, once there lived a horrid pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that's not it,&#8221; said the child
pettishly. &#8220;It's a kitty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it's a pig,&#8221; reiterated Nannie with
emphasis. &#8220;A horrid, selfish pig!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't like that,&#8221; pouted Mamie.
&#8220;You begin about a kitty, and just as
I'm getting interested in her you go off
on a pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, once there was a big, horrid
cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said a dear little kitty,&#8221; cried
Mamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a dear little kitty once, I suppose,
but he grew up to be a big selfish,
glowering, tortoise-shell tomcat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there any mama kitty?&#8221; asked
Mamie, who yearned for a gentle element
in the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and she was lovely, so unselfish
and kind, but the big, ugly one bullied her
all the time till she was afraid to call
her soul her own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they have any teeny weeny kitties?&#8221;
asked Mamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, three of them. The oldest was
very sweet and the next was rather good
sometimes, but showed signs of being
horrid like the big one when he grew up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and the littlest of all was very cunning
and good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they have a little house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it was awfully hard to keep
it, because when Mrs. Kitty wanted anything
she was afraid to ask old Mr. Cat
for it, and when he forgot things, instead
of begging her pardon, as he should
have done, he would glare at her until
she was afraid of her life. Oh, he was an
odious old thing! He thought he was
very big and handsome, but he was horrid-looking,
and everybody hated him
and he made everybody wretched. Well,
one day Mrs. Kitty was going to give a
birthday party for the weeniest kitty.
They none of them wanted old Mr. Cat
to come, because nobody could have a
good time when he was around, but they
didn't know how to get rid of him without
making him angry&mdash;he was always
angry at somebody or something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the family who owned these kitties
had some rabbits, and lately something
had been killing the rabbits, and
they wanted to find out what it was, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
they set a trap. Well, on the birthday
Mrs. Kitty prepared a nice little dinner;
she had some new milk, and a little meat
and a bit of cheese, and six little mice.
The table was so pretty, and everybody
sat down, and there was no end of the fun
going on, until suddenly they all stopped
talking and laughing, for they saw hateful
Mr. Cat. He came sulking and glowering
along, as if somebody outside had
whipped him and he wanted to take it out
of his family. Mrs. Kitty begged him to
sit down, and the little kitty told him it
was her birthday party.</p>

<p>&#8220;'What can I help you to?' asked Mrs.
Kitty in her pretty voice, trying not to
look frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;'None of this stuff,' he growled.
'Haven't you anything decent to eat?'</p>

<p>&#8220;'I'm afraid we haven't anything but
this,' said Mrs. Kitty, her teeth chattering
with dread for fear he'd pounce on
the table and break the dishes. 'Do please
take something,' she begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he only made a great hateful ts-s!
and turned away as mad as he could be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and then down he hopped right into the
rabbit trap, which happened to be near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out came one of the boys of the family,
hallooing and shouting to the others
that he had heard the trap go off and
knew they'd caught the thief, and the
poor little kitties ran away as fast as their
small legs would carry them, not stopping
to see that horrid old Mr. Cat was
held fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of Mr. Cat?&#8221; asked
Mamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;He came to a bad end, as all such
creatures do,&#8221; said Nannie in a terrible
voice.</p>

<p>At this point Jim's interest outran his
pride, and he swung open the door so
that he could hear better.</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of him?&#8221; persisted
Mamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;He received a sound trouncing,&#8221; said
Nannie.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture of affairs she
caught sight of Mr. Earnest's eyes peering
at her above his paper. Had they
been filled with tears or dark with remorse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
she might have relented, but,
shocking to relate, they were fairly
twinkling with merriment, and Nannie
perceived that she was amusing her auditor
hugely, instead of reading him a terrible
lesson, and in her anger she all but
lost control of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn't anything else done to him?&#8221;
asked Jim in a rather disappointed tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nannie, glaring at Mr.
Earnest in a fierce, defiant manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that's enough to do to him,&#8221;
pleaded little Mamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn't,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;He ate up
the rabbits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he didn't eat the rabbits,&#8221;
urged tender-hearted Mamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he didn't eat the rabbits. A
weasel did that,&#8221; said Nannie, her awful
gaze still fixed on Mr. Earnest's laughing
eyes. &#8220;But he had been ugly to his
family, and that's the worst, the meanest
thing a man&mdash;a cat can do, and Providence
caught him in a trap to punish
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else was done to him?&#8221; persisted
Jim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;He was hung,&#8221; said Nannie, and she
almost smacked her lips with savage
relish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Jim, and he condescended
to enter the parlor and plant himself in
front of Nannie. &#8220;Then what else was
done with him?&#8221; reiterated this young
avenging fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't like this story,&#8221; said Mamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;It's most bester
than Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie was going to say that was all,
but just then she caught sight of those
mocking eyes again, and in a sudden fury
she added:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was drawn and quartered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Jim, while Mamie began
to weep.</p>

<p>Just then a roar of laughter ensued
from behind the newspaper, and Nannie,
whose every nerve was taut, leaped from
her chair.</p>

<p>The newspaper fell, and the two chief
actors in this drama confronted one
another, one of them convulsed with
laughter and the other with flashing, defiant
eyes and tightly pursed mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;And after that&mdash;&#8221; urged Jim. &#8220;Go
on, Miss Nannie. Oh, this is a bully
story! It's bestest than Indians!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After that,&#8221; said Nannie, turning
squarely on Mr. Earnest, &#8220;after that he
was sent to the penitentiary for life, and
everybody said 'Good enough!' 'Served
him right, nasty, mean, horrid old
thing!'&#8221; and away she went, slamming
the front door behind her.</p>

<p>The bang of the door, and still more
the unusual sound of Mr. Earnest's
laughter, brought the little wife to the
spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a bully story!&#8221; Master Jim
explained. &#8220;There wasn't any fighting in
it, but a big old cat got caught in a trap,
and he was hung and quartered up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim!&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;Do stop! I
don't like such stories. What could Nannie
have been thinking of?&#8221;</p>

<p>If she had dared she would have
added: &#8220;I don't see how anybody could
have laughed over that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But perhaps she was checked by a look
on Mr. Earnest's face. He was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
laughing now; neither was he scowling;
he looked very grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jennie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come here, dear,&#8221;
and with a quick, unaccustomed flutter of
her heart she went to him. &#8220;I've been a
brute&mdash;a cowardly brute, but I'm sorry,
and I want to do better. Will you forgive
me? And if I behave like a man in
future do you think you can go back to
the old love, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children had run out to see if Nannie
had left them, and the room was very
still; no sound but the ticking of the
clock, and once in awhile a deep sob that
would not be crushed back.</p>

<p>Great events turn on small pivots ofttimes,
and so it happened that there were
some changes in that little house after
this.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, not long after Nannie's
story a great tortoise-shell tomcat
appeared in the Earnest home. No one
thought of asking Mrs. Earnest if she
had brought him there, and the others
knew nothing about him. More curiously
still, when Mr. Earnest began to grow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sulky or ugly, Sir Tortoise Shell would
often walk into the room and glare at
him with his big, ugly eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jennie, I believe I'll shoot that cat!&#8221;
he exclaimed one day. &#8220;I can't bear
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I couldn't let you hurt him,
Gerald,&#8221; said Mrs. Earnest, who had become
quite a spirited little woman in the
new and happy atmosphere she breathed
now. &#8220;I'm so fond of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked demure enough as she
stooped to pet the cat, but really her eyes
were sparkling with mischief, for truth to
tell, she had heard Nannie's story and
was ready to adopt a big yellow cat as her
coat of arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Earnest strolled out on to the gallery.
He too was thinking of that story.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have stood the trouncing,&#8221; he
said to himself, &#8220;and the hanging, and
even the drawing and quartering; but
when it came to sending all four quarters
to the penitentiary for life, what could
a poor devil do but cave in?&#8221;</p>



<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> had passed since Steve refused
to burden himself longer with
Sarah Maria's care and education. As a
matter of course he saw that the irascible
lady was still retained about the place,
but he felt that to be no concern of his
so long as their orbits did not cross,
and so far Sarah Maria seemed to appreciate
his indifference and to thrive upon
it.</p>

<p>A change of base was effected, however,
on the morning of the eighth day,
and it came about in this wise. On going
down to his little corn-field one morning
to see how matters were progressing,
Steve found&mdash;but perhaps we should first
tell how he had, with melancholy eyes,
seen most of the results of his summer's
hard work come to naught; one vegetable
after another had gone the way of the
flesh&mdash;not a legitimate way, as it should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
have gone, on the family table, but by
the path of some violence that had cut off
its usefulness and ended its life prematurely.</p>

<p>The corn was about the only article
that had escaped such wreckage; it really
had flourished and now bade fair to grace
the table before long. Once in a while,
when his spirits needed propping, Steve
allowed himself the comfort of gazing
upon the vigorous cornstalks, with their
budding tassels, and this was his intent
upon this particular day. Alas! the
sight he beheld was hardly calculated to
raise the spiritual thermometer, so to
speak, for Sarah Maria was contentedly
munching what corn she had not already
trampled under foot. Now, this was
more than even Steve could endure, and
for once his gentleness and quiet gave
way to something resembling a wild
storm.</p>

<p>Breaking a stout switch from a tree,
he proceeded to use it with such energy
that Sarah started for the barn at a
sprinting gait. She did not mind being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
sent home&mdash;that she expected as a matter
of course; but she hotly resented the manner
in which it was done. Reaching the
barn and finding the door closed, she suddenly
turned and charged Steve with
such malice and vigor that she was upon
him before he had time to think of escaping
or of defending himself. With one
blow she knocked him down, but happily,
instead of demolishing him at once, she
stood over him glaring and otherwise torturing
him mentally before she could decide
upon the best method by which to
blot him out of existence.</p>

<p>While Steve was thus being rolled as a
sweet morsel of revenge under the tongue
of the vicious Sarah, Brownie came running
from the house. Possibly he beheld
his master's predicament and wished to
succor him; possibly he was animated by
the spirit of mischief which seemed to
possess him most of the time. However
that may be, he collided with a hive of
bees as he ran and upset it. Then swift
as a flash he fled to a large tree growing
nearby and stood upon his little hind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
feet close to its trunk, in such a manner
that he was completely hidden from view.</p>

<p>The bees, raging out of their house and
looking about them for the enemy who
had knocked so rudely at their back door
as to overturn the entire building, beheld
Sarah Maria standing rampant over the
prostrate Steve. The latter looked meek
enough, but the former was evidently
equal to anything vicious. Accepting this
circumstantial evidence without investigation,
the bees sallied forth in a body
and proceeded to punish the wicked cow,
and in about one minute Mrs. Maria was
dancing a fisher's hornpipe of the most
extravagant character. With tail tilted
at a disrespectful angle, she careened in
such fashion as to bring her flying heels
close to Steve's terrified nose. Meanwhile
he lay still, watching proceedings
with gentle amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most extraordinary conduct,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>By-and-by, thinking the time ripe for
escape, he attempted to rise and slip
away, but the eagle eye of the festive
bovine caught his first movement, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
pounced upon him so viciously that nothing
but his feigning to be dead saved his
life. Just at this junction the kitchen
door opened, and Bridget, who had observed
these high proceedings from the
window, put out her head and screamed
&#8220;Murther!&#8221; on hearing which Sarah
dashed toward the house, but was back
again upon Steve before he had a chance
to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upset another hive, me dear!&#8221;
screamed Bridget. &#8220;Sure a big dose of
bees will be good fer her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah Maria again galloped toward
the kitchen, and Bridget hastily withdrew
her counsel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure it's the divil himsilf broke
loose!&#8221; shouted Bridget again, opening
the door a crack. &#8220;I'd know his horns
an' tail anywheres, bad cess to him!
Howly Mither! how shall I get yez into
the house? It's a state of siege I'm in
here, or I'd be out a-dhraggin' yez inside.
Don't raise yer hid, Mr. Loveland&mdash;don't
now, me dear, as ye love yer life, or fust
ye know she'll go a-bowlin' of it 'roun'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
that yard as if it was a billiard bawl.
She's got no more heart in her brist than
that. Och! bad luck ter her! Shure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But again Sarah Maria started to interview
the cook, and again Bridget had
a pressing engagement indoors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Och! what shall we do now? Shure
it's quakin' I am fer fear ivery minute.
I'll see your gory head bouncin' 'roun' the
potaty patch an' her afther it. May the
saints defind yez from sich a horrible
fate. Och! look at that, now!&#8221; she
shrieked as Sarah made another lurch in
Steve's direction. &#8220;Perlice! perlice!&#8221; she
screamed, so loud that she might have
been heard in the city. &#8220;Shure I hope I
may live ter see that ould divil hangin'
ter the apple tree an' the crows fasteing
off her wicked ould body. There, now,
come, Mr. Loveland&mdash;she's off! Och!
good luck ter thim bees! Git up now, me
darlint! There, rin! rin fer yer life!
Och! she's comin' agin!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Steve reached the kitchen door
first, and Bridget reached forth a welcoming
hand and snatched him inside,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
his coat being rent in twain by the violence
of his salvation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure, now, that's a cow fer a respictable
middle-aged woman twilve years
over from Oireland ter sit down an' milk
when she's not yit ready ter die&mdash;is it,
now? An' a respictable family ter drink
the milk of an' not expect ter be cuttin'
up shines an' capers an' all sorts of
wicked things in consequence&mdash;is it, I
say? Luck at that, now! Haven't I told
yez that cow hasn't the manners ov a
leddy, at all, at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Maria was at that moment clearing
the fence and dancing down the road,
pursued by a hive of bees.</p>

<p>&#8220;May the divil claim his own an' sit
her up next ter him down where the both
ov thim belongs!&#8221; was Bridget's pious
wish as she disappeared.</p>

<p>Steve had hardly more than had time
to change his clothes, which fortunately
had received all the damage in the recent
scrimmage, when he saw Nannie hurrying
down the road. She was half running,
half walking, and her face was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
radiantly happy that Steve went out to
learn the good tidings she evidently bore.
So eager was she to impart her news that
she called out before he reached her:</p>

<p>&#8220;It's happened! It's happened! It's
all over! and it's so little&mdash;and the dearest&mdash;oh,
Steve&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She could say no more, for her words
were cut short just here and her excitement
found vent in a happy sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear,&#8221; said Steve, taking
her gently by the arm and leading her
toward the house.</p>

<p>But Nannie resisted:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I'm going right
back, I only came home for you. You
must go right over. Randolph is wild.
Oh, it's so dear and sweet! Just like a
rose! I could smother it with kisses!&#8221;</p>

<p>She would hardly let him go for his
hat, and all the way over she dragged him
along, insisting upon greater speed and
chattering in an excited, happy way that
was perfectly new and perfectly delightful
to Steve.</p>

<p>Randolph was on the lookout for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
them, and his excitement was no less than
Nannie's.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must see the pretty little baby,
old man,&#8221; he said after an impetuous
hand-shaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, do let me see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't say <i>it</i>,&#8221; exclaimed Nannie. &#8220;It's
a little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear&mdash;really&mdash;you forgot
to mention which it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Randolph entered with a
bundle of shawls, which he reverently
and delightedly opened.</p>

<p>All at once his face changed and a look
of blank dismay effaced his happy, expectant
expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;W&mdash;why, where is she?&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Randolph Chance!&#8221; blazed Nannie,
snatching the bundle from him, &#8220;I could
slap you! You've got her upside down!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; groaned Randolph. &#8220;Will it
kill her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may!&#8221; said Nannie fiercely.
&#8220;You've no business with her! Holding
her heels up! Poor little thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And she laid her face on the tiny
human doll and cooed to it, and soothed
it, while the father stood there&mdash;big,
helpless, remorseful, solicitous, and tender.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take her,&#8221; said Steve quietly,
holding out his hands.</p>

<p>Nannie's first impulse was to say &#8220;No&#8221;
and to press the baby closer to her, but
something in Steve's face arrested the
word she would have spoken, and she
placed the precious little charge in his
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare, old man, one would think
you had had a dozen at least!&#8221; said Randolph,
looking on admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's the first very young child I ever
held,&#8221; said Steve.</p>

<p>Nannie was still. She and Randolph
were looking at Steve, and Steve was
looking into the little face that lay upon
his arm. For a moment no one spoke;
then Nannie said abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Constance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm afraid I can't let you, Nannie,&#8221;
said Randolph. &#8220;She doesn't seem quite
as well as she did awhile ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must see her,&#8221; said Nannie
emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear,&#8221; Steve began gently,
&#8220;perhaps to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I must see her now. I've something
to tell her. It will make her well.
I <i>must</i> see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was so determined that Randolph
reluctantly consented, and she passed
into Constance's room, leaving the baby
with Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Constance,&#8221; said Nannie, stepping up
to the bedside, &#8220;you are going to get well,
aren't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, of course,&#8221; said Constance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to tell you, you must. I think
it would be wicked to leave the little baby
in the world without a mother. No one
would ever love her and no one would
teach her to do things and how to be
good, and she would be so lonely, and she
wouldn't know how to come near people
and say anything, no matter if her heart
was bursting.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Nannie sank by the bed and wept
as a woman does sometimes when her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
sobs break their way out and she can't
stop them.</p>

<p>A flood seemed to pour upon Constance,
and in it she saw the lonely,
yearning, ignorant child-wife as she
really was. She also saw how unjust she
herself had been, and pity and remorse
laid hold upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie! dear Nannie&mdash;you poor little
thing! Come here. I want to tell
you that I love you. I never knew you
before and Steve loves you if only you
would let him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nannie was on her feet again.
Her words had been spoken, and all the
crudity that had been swept aside for a
moment returned in full force and awkwardness.
Without even a glance at Constance
she abruptly left the room, and in a
few moments she and Steve were walking
homeward.</p>



<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sarah Maria</span> was gone and baby
Chance was thriving. There was bliss
enough for any reasonable man, and
Steve waxed almost light of heart. All
this had come about with time, and other
things might come, too, if time were not
interfered with. The news of Sarah's
rapid transit had hardly cost Nannie the
lifting of an eyebrow. She was so absorbed
in the baby that she could well
afford to spare her amiable bovine.</p>

<p>Although it was quite late in the fall,
Steve was actually contemplating the
planting of another crop. Now that the
main enemy had withdrawn her horns
and heels from the garden, winter seemed
a mere bagatelle in the way of opposition&mdash;an
obstacle too small for reckoning.</p>

<p>But, as poets and prose writers have
abundantly proven, Ill Fortune has an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
ugly habit of coming around a corner
with a sudden demoniac swish when least
expected and she certainly did this time.
Steve was out in his garden drinking in
the mellow stillness of an Indian summer
twilight, and feeling not really happy perhaps&mdash;a
man who has a home only in
name can hardly be that&mdash;but rested and
at peace at that particular moment, which
is much more than could be asserted of
his condition the next, for as he looked
down the road he beheld Sarah Maria
gamboling along, having in tow at the
end of a rope a well-spent, perspiring
darky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis yere yo' cow, massa?&#8221; asked the
weary African as he came up.</p>

<p>Steve hesitated; he was sorely tempted
to repudiate madam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain't yo's Massa Lubland?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve nodded in a gloomy manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Den I reckon dis yere b'longs to yo',&#8221;
he said confidently, and he tugged and
pulled the unruly beast within the boundary
of the cow-yard, with no further damage
to the place than the trampling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
several choice plants and the breaking of
a young apple tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do I owe you?&#8221; asked
Steve in a tone of subdued melancholy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, massa, I's gwine tell yo' my
story, an' den I lebes it to yo' to do de
right ting by me. Yo' see, dis yere cow
come to me jes' 'bout tree months ago,
an' my wife she 'lowed it was a giff, but
I sez, 'No, sah, no giffs come a-droppin'
out de sky dat a-way. Dis yere b'longs
to some ob de quality folk, an' dey's
a-gwine to want her some day, so we
mus' keep her up right smart, an' dey'll
pay us fer all our trubble.' So we fed her
ob de fat ob de lan', but 'peared like she
were de kin' dat keeps lean anyways;
dat's why she look so kin' o' pulin' now.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was so contrairy to manage dat
I got kin' o' skeered ob her, an' one day
she tuk me in de pit ob de stomach an'
h'isted me ober de fence, an' I hed mis'ry
in de stomach an' mis'ry in de back, an'
my wife 'lowed I was gwine ter die. It
tuk de doctor an' a powerful lot o' medicine
ter sot me up agin, an' I was kin' o'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
porely fer a long time. Bimeby we heerd
de cow b'longed ter Massa Lubland, an'
yo' libed out heah, an' jes' den a neighbor
come 'long wid a load o' furn'ture an' I
ax him:</p>

<p>&#8220;'Could yo' take de cow?'</p>

<p>&#8220;'Ef she'll hitch on I could,' he say.
'Is she peaceable or is she ornery?'</p>

<p>&#8220;'She's ornery heah,' I say, 'but she's
gwine ter wawk 'long lak a lady when
she's gwine home, 'case she's homesick.'</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, massa, he done tuk her, but
when he come back from de city he tole
me she jes' sot herself agin goin', an' she
sot so hard de hosses couldn't pull nohow,
an' when he got down to loose her she
rared till she fetched some o' de furn'ture
down on her haid, an' dar was a nice table
broke ter kindlin' wood, an' I hed ter pay
him five dollars fer it. An' jes' as I put
de pocket book up agin&mdash;an' it was plum'
empty&mdash;roun' de corner come de cow,
wid her eyes on fire, an' she jes' strewed

An' massa, sho's yo's bawn, she hooked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
an' tossed me like a rubber bawl all de

anywhares in my body. Lordy! but she's
a turrible critter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I owe you ten dollars?&#8221; asked
Steve with grim resignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I takes whatever yo' gives, massa, an'
I doan complain; but I knows yo's hon'rable,
an' yo's gwine ter 'member I was
laid up from work a week an' hed ter

her plum' full fer tree months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I owe you fifteen dollars?&#8221; asked
Steve.</p>

<p>The darky looked mournful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I owe you twenty?&#8221; asked Steve
in a somewhat severe tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon yo' hain't gwine ter fergit I
paid five fer de table,&#8221; murmured this
meek son of Africa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take twenty-five, then, and make an
end of it,&#8221; said Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tank yo', tank yo', massa. I hain't
nebber gwine ter fergit yo' ner de cow.
Gawd bress yo' bofe, massa.&#8221;</p>

<p>And grinning and bowing he disappeared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
leaving Steve minus a fifth of his
monthly salary and plus the beautiful
Sarah Maria.</p>

<p>It was part of the procession of events
that the butcher should heave in sight at
that moment, and that Steve should hail
him and take him in to look at the returned
prodigal.</p>

<p>&#8220;She's so lean she wouldn't be good for
much,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;If you'd fatten
her up I'd&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think not. I'd rather you'd
take her now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn't give you but ten dollars for
her this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take her,&#8221; said Steve.</p>

<p>And the bargain was concluded. Shortly
after this Bridget was ill with cramps
for a few days.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has upset you?&#8221; asked Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn't tell at fust,&#8221; groaned Bridget,
&#8220;but I mind now&mdash;it's thet Sarah
Meriah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she's gone! What can she have
to do with you now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure she was in that last beefsteak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
I ate. I recognized her the minnit she
passed me lips. 'Are ye back agin?' sez
I, 'bad cess ter yez!' 'Thrue fer yez,' sez
she, 'an' I'll be ther upsettin' of yez yit.'
An' faith she is, fer it's feel her I do this
blissed minnit, hookin' me in'ards an'
kickin' me vitals, an' behavin' in a most
disgraceful and unleddylike fashion
throughout.&#8221;</p>

<p>Possibly Nannie found herself more
at leisure, now her bovine charge was off
her hands, and wanted occupation, or&mdash;and
this is more likely&mdash;the beauty and
comfort of Randolph's and Constance's
home had stolen to her heart and stirred
new impulses there. Other influences had
been at work on this neglected region as
well, but to these Nannie did not as yet
yield their meed of credit. It is a sad
but well-known fact that the home agencies
for regeneration are the last to receive
recognition and gratitude. So it
was that while Nannie was dimly conscious
that she owed something to Constance's
womanliness, she refused to
dwell upon the beauty and tenderness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Steve's conduct toward her. His uniform
courtesy, gentleness, and forbearance,
though the most powerful factors
in her dissatisfaction with self and embryonic
yearnings toward a more conscientious,
nobler life, were as yet utterly
ignored by her in actual thought, and had
her attention been called to them, she
would probably have denied that she
owed aught of good to their influence.
This was discouraging, to be sure, but
one must wait long and patiently for full
results. It was enough, perhaps, for the
present that Nannie went about her home
trying, in a blundering way, to bring to
pass some changes for the better. With
a deeper insight than she recognized she
looked to her table, first of all. Bridget
was not a first-class cook, and her limited
repertory rendered the bill of fare wearisome
and monotonous.</p>

<p>Several dishes that Nannie had seen on
Constance's table had caught her eye.
A tempting salad was one, and having
learned how to make it, she gave her own
table the benefit of this knowledge one
evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve's face lighted with surprise and
pleasure the moment the new and very
attractive dish was brought on. He knew
it was none of Bridget's making.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be yours, my dear,&#8221; he said
with a gentle, winning smile.</p>

<p>Now, poor Nannie was terribly awkward
about anything that involved a
show of feeling, so instead of taking this
as she should have done, she merely said
brusquely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I made it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she colored violently, then immediately
looked defiant.</p>

<p>But her color and her defiance were
both of them so pretty and engaging that
Steve was moved by a rare impulse to go
round to her and kiss her.</p>

<p>Shocking as it may seem, Nannie
caught him by the nose with a sudden
fierce motion and held on with grim, unrelenting
grasp.</p>

<p>The whole scene occurred in a flash,
as it were, and Steve was utterly unprepared
for his own act, and still more so
for its consequence. Impulsiveness with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
him, however, was unusual and short-lived,
and even under these untoward
circumstances he soon recovered his gentle
gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to release my
nose, Nannie?&#8221; he said in his accustomed
quiet tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness knows!&#8221; she replied
brusquely&mdash;possibly without intent to pun&mdash;but
she let go.</p>

<p>Steve retreated a step or two and
seemed undecided as to what course to
pursue. A certain air of dignity and reserve
enveloped him at all times, and up
to the present moment this had never
failed to be respected by those with
whom he had come in contact. It was
hardly possible, then, to pass by so flagrant
an outrage as this in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;you
mean all the things you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean every one!&#8221; snapped Nannie,
whose resentment was stirred, all the
more so because she was ashamed of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is the case,&#8221; Steve replied, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
as he spoke, quietly and without anger,
he was conscious of a dull dread of her
reply&mdash;&#8220;if that is the case, it can't be that
you feel either love or respect for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I don't, then,&#8221; said Nannie
rudely, and she rose from the table and
went out into the garden.</p>

<p>Steve stood irresolute for a time; then
he took his hat and left the house. Never
in all his life before had he felt as miserable
and as helpless. At that moment the
beauty died not only out of his own life,
but out of nature as well. There was no
longer a balm in Gilead. He walked on,
instinctively taking one of his old paths,
from which he had heretofore received
so much of comfort and inspiration, but
which to-night gave him absolutely nothing
of either. It would seem that nature
had shared the blow he had received and
had been deadened by it. Poor Mother Nature,
she was just the same, but her child
was out of gear and she could do nothing
but wait. By-and-by a change came, not
in the way of happiness, perhaps, but in a
lightening of that deadness which is of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
necessity the most hopeless of all conditions.</p>

<p>Awaking from his torpor to a certain
extent, Steve found himself engaged
in some practical thoughts. He had lately
been balancing his books, and the result
was not encouraging. He was now reviewing
this with a certain grim despondency
and also a certain grim humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;We've spent eighteen hundred dollars
in one year. I earn fifteen hundred a
year and there's six hundred in the bank.
We've just one year and two months to
live. We'd better begin to repent,&#8221; he
said to himself.</p>

<p>Then presently he began to wonder
what the use of it all was. He had given
Nannie shelter and protection&mdash;that was
all there was to it. They were no more
to each other than strangers. He had
done his utmost, and she was as far away
from him as ever; that made an end of
hope; he might as well give it up. At
that moment there was nothing he would
have liked better. What with the care
and perplexity he had endured over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
women, cows, and hens, he was more than
ready to wash his hands of the entire lot.</p>

<p>But Steve was unaccustomed to following
inclination when duty pointed in
another direction, so although he was apparently
doing that now, yet he had no
other thought than of returning to his
post by-and-by.</p>

<p>He walked on in an aimless sort of
fashion, merely because he did not know
what else to do just then, and soon found
himself near the cottage whose glorified
windows attracted him on his tramp some
time ago. It was dull enough now, for
the departing sunlight streamed in
another direction, leaving the little house
in shadow. Steve would have passed it
without a thought had not a woman's
cry caught his ear&mdash;a bitter, wailing cry,
on which came words as bitter:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I'm sick of it all! Would God
that I were dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without meaning to intrude on private
grief, Steve stood stock-still. There was
something so horrible in the contrast between
a cry of such lawless despair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and the idea of the contentment and happiness
for which that little house should
stand that it fairly paralyzed the man's
steps, just as the motion of the heart is
arrested by a shock.</p>

<p>The cottage stood on the edge of the
woods. Just now these were bare and
gaunt, and the steep-sided ravine to the
left seemed to-day a barren crack in a
gloomy landscape.</p>

<p>It was all of it unbearable, unendurable.
Anything was better than this, and
Steve turned with relief in the direction
of a familiar train whistle, hurried to the
station, and soon was speeding toward his
former bachelor quarters.</p>

<p>How desolate the old building looked
when he reached it! The sun had sunk
below the tall chimney tops, and the narrow
street lay in gloomy shadow. Nothing
daunted, however, Steve entered, and
forgetful of the custom of the building,
he stepped to the elevator shaft. It was
dark, but looking far up he thought he
could discern a faint glimmer of the sunset.
Some lines he once read came to
him:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The emptying tide of life has drained the iron channel dry;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Strange winds from the forgotten day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw down, and dream, and sigh:&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They were passing and repassing him&mdash;these
winds. A sigh, a certain coolness,
a faint whisper&mdash;that was all as they entered
the shaft and sped upward like
ghosts of a busy world.</p>

<p>Steve turned and ran rapidly up the
stairs. He could hardly fit his key, he
was in such haste to escape from that
lonesome hallway. Day was passing out
by the western gate when he entered his
room, and it would seem that heaven, in
all its untold beauty, had come forth to
greet her. Such a sky! It fairly overwhelmed
him, and he turned to the east,
as one seeks shelter in the shadow from
a too brilliant light. Even the east was
whispering the story, but gently and in
cadences fit for weak human senses, just
as winds in the tall tree-tops faintly repeat
the harmonies of heaven.</p>

<p>To and fro Steve walked in the spacious
lonesome apartments. Was his present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
solitude an earnest of his future?
Was he forever to be denied the warm
human clasp of another's hand? Was he
doomed evermore to see the oncoming
of the night from out some deserted
room?</p>

<p>The west was fading now. Day had
passed and carried light and sunshine
with her. The clouds were moving hither
and yonder restlessly, and in their ghostly
passage they took on weird shapes.</p>

<p>Steve watched them with a strange interest&mdash;an
interest just tinged with superstition,
half rejecting, half receiving their
import, something as one watches the
shifting of cards in the hands of a wizard.</p>

<p>He looked out over the waters of the
lake, but the east was leaden now; her
lips were sealed; she had passed silently
into the night. Even in the west there
was but a fitful glowing, and the clouds
came and went.</p>

<p>The room had grown black&mdash;insupportable!
Steve could not endure it&mdash;he
must light it in some way. A lamp would
not do. It was a warm evening, wonderfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
warm for that season, but he must
have firelight.</p>

<p>He looked about him and soon found
kindling and fuel, for he had as yet disturbed
none of the room's furnishings.
His lease was not spent; he could use the
place for storage for quite a time yet.</p>

<p>The warmth of the cheery flame was
welcome to him, for despite the heat of
the evening he felt a chilliness which he
did not know meant fever. It was not
among possibilities that a man of Steve's
fine sensitive fiber could do violence to
his idea of right without disaster to his
physical being. He had fled from his
post of duty, he felt himself to be a deserter,
and this deflection was necessarily
accompanied by physical disturbance.</p>

<p>As he sat beside the bright blaze he
heard Randolph telling of his successful
wooing and saw him tilted back in his
chair against the opposite wall of the
chimney. Then he stepped from out the
ingle-nook and stood in a little old cemetery.
They were putting mother and
Mary into the same grave, and he thought
the gravediggers cruel because they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hurled the clods of earth so heavily upon
them.</p>

<p>The cemetery was growing colder now,
and he wakened, oppressed with the
dreariness of it all. He replenished his
failing fire and then sat down to dream
again, but this time he was not alone, for
Nannie sat by the cheery little blaze&mdash;not
across the way, but close by his side.
She had all her brilliant beauty, all her
tantalizing, bewitching ways, but he no
longer feared to touch her; no longer
feared to smooth back the tangled curls
and kiss the dear, piquant face, for the
drawbridge was down, the gates were
flung open, and Castle Delight was his
at last.</p>

<p>It was a great moment for Steve. Now
he had life and had it abundantly; now
he had wife and hearthstone.</p>

<p>He wakened again in a cold, dark
room, and he saw gleaming through the
blackness a tearful, wistful face which
he knew was Nannie's. She was in
trouble&mdash;she wanted something, she was
calling him in weird, spirit fashion, and
he must go!</p>



<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Nannie went out into the garden
she saw old Hayseed leaning over the
fence contemplating some of the ruins of
Steve's vegetables. Glad of any diversion,
she opened a conversation on the
subject of Mr. Seymour, of whose death
she had heard that day. In far-away
times, old Hayseed had known Mr. Seymour's
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't think he could die,&#8221; said Nannie.
&#8220;He was always trying to, but I
didn't think he was really sick enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hed ter die ter vindercate hisself,&#8221;
said Hayseed. &#8220;Some folks, yer know,
hez ter live ter set 'emselves right, but
this one 'bleeged ter die. He was
allers goin' on erbout his bein' out o'
health, an' nobody believed him, so he
was 'bleeged ter die. Mrs. Seymour's
young woman was tellin' me she tho't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
he died to spite folks that wouldn't 'low
he was sick. She said he was mean
enough to do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was; mean as he could be!&#8221; exclaimed
Nannie. &#8220;He was so little and so
narrow-minded, and he had no excuse
for it either, for he had a good education
and he'd been all over the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, once in awhile ye see a
prune that won't swell. Ye put 'em all
in water alike, an' most on 'em gits fat
an' smooth, but this one stays small an'
shriveled up. There's no accountin' fer
ther difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie turned and walked toward the
house. She was restless and felt at a
loss to know what to do with herself.
Since her caper in the garden Steve had
left her absolutely to her own way, and
she had found, as folks will soon or late,
that nothing could be more dreary. She
finally started over to see her cousins, the
Misfits, but on her way thither she had occasion
to pass the house of some plain
folk by the name of Meader, and she suddenly
decided to go in there. It was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
same house from which Steve had heard
that anguished wail, and when Nannie
entered, shortly after Steve had passed
on, she found Mrs. Meader weeping bitterly.
The woman was so far gone in
misery that she did not resent Nannie's
entrance or her question.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can't stand it no longer. He
don't give me nothin' to git anything
with, an' we can't live on nothin'. Whenever
he gits mad he plagues me by keepin'
everything out o' my han's, an' he won't
answer when I ask him fer anything. I'd
like to know if a woman an' five children
kin live without money! Before I was
married I used to earn some. I had
enough to live on, but now, what with the
cookin', an' washin' an' nussin' all these
babies, I ain't no time ter earn a livin'!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say you <i>were</i> earning it!
You earn more than he does!&#8221; exclaimed
Nannie hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He don't look at it that way,&#8221; sobbed
the woman. &#8220;He's ferever makin' me
feel so beholten ter him fer every penny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
an' ter-day when I needed some money
awful fer tea an' I went ter his pocket an'
got it, he went on so afore ther children
it seems like I can't never look them in
ther face agin. He said&mdash;he said&#8221;&mdash;she
stammered amid her sobs&mdash;&#8220;thet I was a
thief&mdash;a low-down common thief&mdash;that's
what he said, and the children heard
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie rose from her chair with
clinched hands and a flaming face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; she asked under her
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's gone ter ther grocery. He ain't
working ter-day. He said he'd 'tend ter
the spendin' of the money. I couldn't be
trusted with it. He said thet, he did,
afore the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she broke down again.</p>

<p>Just then the man himself came walking
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's up now?&#8221; he asked when he
saw Nannie's face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are!&#8221; she blazed, &#8220;and you're a
contemptible brute!&#8221;</p>

<p>His face flushed. He looked both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ashamed and angry, but a man in his position
is at a loss to know what to do when
attacked by a woman outside his family.
He had enough pride to shrink from this
invasion of his affairs, but he did not
know just how to resent it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain't no matter fer discussion,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but she's been into my pockets, an'
thet's what I can't stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you steal her money for,
then?&#8221; demanded Nannie.</p>

<p>He stared at her in stupid astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's you who steal!&#8221; continued Nannie
in ringing tones. &#8220;There she is, earning
more than you do, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know how you make that out,&#8221;
said the man in a sulky tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to hire some one to take her place,
and you'll learn. She could hire your
work done fast enough, but there never
has been and there never will be money
enough in all your horrid pockets put
together to hire what she does for you
and the children; and then you are so
nasty, and mean, and dishonest as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
clutch the money and pretend you have
the right to dole out what belongs to her.
I wonder you aren't ashamed to be alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>He certainly did look ashamed now.
He had probably never before viewed
matters from this point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don't suppose I done just the
right thing. I'm not going ter deny it,
but money comes hard, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And her life is hard enough, anyhow,
without your making it harder by tyrannizing
over her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here one of the five little ones began to
cry, and the mother started forward to
take it, but Nannie intercepted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go and get your dinner,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I'll look after the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>And taking the two youngest in her
arms she coaxed the others along,
and they all went out into the warm,
pleasant sunlight, and there Nannie sang
to them, told them stories, washed their
dirty little faces, and mothered them generally
until their own poor mother could
recover herself and their father had time
to see the error of his way and repent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun was setting when Nannie
wended her way homeward. She dreaded
to see Steve, but found relief in the
thought that he would probably appear
as usual. When she learned that he had
not returned she felt surprised, but decided
not to wait dinner, and so ate alone.</p>

<p>She spent the evening at her cousin's
house. She did not quite dare to go to
Constance's, for she instinctively felt that
Constance would heartily disapprove of
her leaving home in that way at a time
when her husband was likely to be alone.</p>

<p>Returning, she found the house dark.
Steve had probably retired, and she remembered
she had given Bridget permission
to go to the city for the night to look
after a sick cousin. Something impelled
her to do an unusual thing&mdash;open Steve's
door a crack and peep in. He was not
there.</p>

<p>The shock of this discovery was so
great that for a moment Nannie was almost
too bewildered to know what she
did, and was half frightened when she
found herself at the front door calling
&#8220;Steve! Steve!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The leaves rustling on the trees in the
soft night wind was her only answer, and
she closed the door with a feeling of desolate
misery new to her experience.</p>

<p>At no time was she afraid. The fact
of her being alone in the house merely
served to emphasize her realization of her
loss, for she had no doubt that Steve had
left her. There was no resentment in her
attitude now; she felt that she deserved
her fate. None the less she also felt that
she could not endure it&mdash;could not live
without Steve. And yet she had told him
that very day that she had neither love
nor respect for him. How could he stay
with her after that?</p>

<p>The night passed somehow, and morning
found Nannie with a white face, save
where the shadows rested 'neath her
large eyes.</p>

<p>Bridget had not yet come home, and
she could not endure to stay alone any
longer, so she wrapped a little parcel and
started over to Constance's. The parcel
was one of a set of articles she was learning
to make. Some weeks before this she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
had appeared at Constance's one day, and
unrolling a large bundle she carried, had
spread upon the latter's bed a quantity
of tiny clothing, cut and made in most
original fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Nannie!&#8221; exclaimed Constance,
who had no other idea than that they
were meant for little baby Chance. &#8220;How
lovely of you! Thank you ever so much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They're not for you,&#8221; said Nannie in
her crude way. &#8220;They're mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chagrin and embarrassment Constance
might have felt over her mistake
was swallowed up now in her amazement
and delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours! Oh, Nannie, I'm so glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven't any use for them,&#8221; said
Nannie, bluntly, &#8220;but&#8221;&mdash;and here there
was a hardly perceptible quiver of her
lips&mdash;&#8220;I just wanted them around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare, that's really pathetic,&#8221; said
Randolph afterward when Constance told
him. &#8220;Why don't you teach her, sweetheart&mdash;teach
her to make the pretty little
things?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Constance did, and as a result of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
all the ripping and cutting over Nannie
had made some exquisite little garments,
two of which she presented to Constance,
and the rest kept in a little chiffonier in
her room, to gaze at and kiss many times
a day.</p>

<p>Returning from her sewing lesson
rather earlier than usual, for she longed
and dreaded to go back to her house, she
found Steve awaiting her.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the little parlor, and
his face was flushed and his eyes strangely
bright.</p>

<p>Nannie stood stock-still on the threshold
when she saw him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; she asked at length, &#8220;have
you come back to live with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, and then something impelled
him to hold out his arms to her.</p>

<p>She hesitated, wavered for a moment
like some beautiful wild bird that had
strayed from the forest; then she ran to
him in headlong fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve!&#8221; she fairly cried, &#8220;I can't
make the words, but you know! you
know!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve folded her in his arms and&mdash;the
dream came true. In the rapture of that
moment he knew indeed&mdash;knew that this
strange, untutored child was the one
woman in all the world to satisfy him.</p>



<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> has run on. It is just three years
from the morning Steve came home. He
was quite ill for awhile after that, and
from his feverish talk Nannie learned
several things. In his convalescence they
became acquainted, and Steve felt that his
wife's handy, pretty nursing was the
sweetest experience he had ever known.</p>

<p>Shortly after he was on his feet again
Nannie returned from Constance's,
whither she had run of an errand one
morning, with a great distress working on
her face.</p>

<p>She entered the study, where Steve
sat at his desk writing, and tried to speak,
but words failed her, and she sobbed instead.</p>

<p>Steve went to her quickly, and his
gentle face and manner were eloquent
with concern and sympathy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear, what <i>has</i> happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's the little baby! She's been <i>so</i> ill
all night! She can't live!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear! Oh, that is too sad!&#8221;
and Steve's face flushed and quivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come right back with me,
Steve; they are in such grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went in without pausing to ring
and tiptoed their way to Constance's
room. The house was very still.</p>

<p>In response to their soft tap Randolph
opened the door. When he saw Steve
he broke into a great sob and laid his
head on the shoulder of the dear friend
of olden days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is she gone?&#8221; cried Nannie, entering
the room.</p>

<p>Constance nodded and turned away,
but Nannie burst into uncontrollable grief
as she saw the little white-faced figure
lying in the crib.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never want a child!&#8221; cried Nannie
passionately. &#8220;If God can be so cruel as
to take her, I never want one!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Constance who was forced to
comfort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Don't say that, dear,&#8221; she urged gently.
&#8220;I don't understand why we couldn't
keep her, but I <i>know</i> that God is good.
And we'd rather have her this way than
never to have held our own little
baby&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here she broke down and wept convulsively
over the tiny crib.</p>

<p>And Steve and Nannie wept as they
went homeward together hand in hand.</p>

<p>There is another baby there now&mdash;a
jolly, roystering little fellow, just one year
old to-day, on his mother's birthday, and a
very precious little man he is; but the dear
little girl who just alighted in their arms
long enough to lay hold upon their heartstrings
and then flew away with the other
angels is not forgotten.</p>

<p>Randolph stepped over to Steve's desk
this morning to ask if he and Nannie
would be sure to come in the evening to
celebrate the double birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it's at all clear we will, old man,
and gladly,&#8221; said Steve, &#8220;but it looks to
me as if a big storm were brewing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you can come. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
think a deal of these anniversaries. Each
one of 'em marks off a happy year, I tell
you, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said Steve gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the years have been successful,
too,&#8221; continued Randolph. &#8220;On the
whole&mdash;to speak between friends&mdash;I've
managed pretty well, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty well with one,&#8221; said Steve, and
there was a slight gleam in his eye as he
recalled Randolph's bachelor boast that he
could manage forty women. &#8220;Now for
the thirty-nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; said Randolph, &#8220;you're a good
fellow, but you'll have to let up on that
forty. I had sense enough, after all, to
marry only one of them, and occasionally
I have my doubts&mdash;looks a little as if even
that one managed me. Just you drop the
thirty-nine. You're using the poker too
freely.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then they fell to talking about how
warm it was on this same day three years
ago.</p>

<p>Steve was right, for that afternoon it
began to snow and it forgot to stop. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
had hard work to get home and still
harder to get out and attend to the little
stock. The chickens, he found, had had
the sense to go to roost before time; both
Brownie and the cat were safe indoor;
they could look out for themselves, but
the gentle, fawn-like Jersey (quite a different
animal from the wild-eyed beast of
three years agone) had expectations, and
she must needs receive especial care.</p>

<p>After Steve had fed her and seen that
she was comfortable for the night, he
made his way into the house with a feeling
that only a very happy man can understand.</p>

<p>Nannie was busy upstairs and called to
him not to come up, as she had a surprise
in store. He was to stir the fire and
set her chair, which she would fill directly,
and Steve had done all this and now was
walking about the room, which was bright
and pretty in the firelight, handling the
books and magazines, trying a chord or
two on the piano, and looking occasionally
from the windows out into the night.</p>

<p>That was wild enough, what with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
wind, and ice, and snow. Every now and
then the little house shuddered in the
blast, which was shrieking in the chimneys.
The window glass was bearded
with snow, which melted here and there
and ran for a little space; then, lest one
should fancy the weather were shedding
repentant tears, it stiffened into ice
straightway. Down at the foot of the
bluff the lake was booming; there was
something to make the blood run cold
about its mighty passion. One thought
of the boats at its mercy that night and
whispered, God help them!</p>

<p>There, in the center of it all, 'neath the
trees that were clashing arms with one
another in the storm, stood the snug little
home, with the study, over whose pictured
walls the cheery, flickering light played
at glow and shadow. And there, close to
the merry blaze, poker in hand, sat Steve,
as happy, as well content a man as you'd
find, though you looked far and wide.
Brownie occupied the other chair, and it
appeared that he had much to say. Nannie
was singing&mdash;singing to the baby upstairs&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Steve and Brownie hearkened
to the pretty notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear that, sir?&#8221; asked Brownie,
with his head slightly tilted and cocked on
one side.</p>

<p>Steve poked assent at the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn't think much of her at one
time, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve was gravely shocked and
promptly poked remonstrance into the
glowing coals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you were rather discouraged
about her&mdash;you know that,&#8221; persisted
Brownie.</p>

<p>Steve looked ashamed, but he was honest
enough to nod slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now you see there isn't a less
wearisome, a nicer, brighter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Steve interrupted by stabbing the
fire's front in a manner betokening the
heartiest concurrence.</p>

<p>Just at this point the subject of these
thrusts entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don't, Steve&mdash;no, sir. You
shan't even have a squint till I get to the
fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And carefully covering Miss Baby
from view, Nannie sidled along to her
chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now! Ask daddy what he thinks of
Miss Loveland!&#8221; she exclaimed, dropping
all disguises suddenly and holding
the pretty little creature up in the firelight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Nannie! short clothes!&#8221; said
Steve with an admiring gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nannie. &#8220;Look at the
darling little shoes! See her kick them!
Oh, she's so glad to be rid of those long
dresses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve's poker was greatly agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie,&#8221; he said, in his quiet way, &#8220;I
hardly think I can wait much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you shall have her. Now!
Here she goes, daddy!&#8221; and Nannie
tossed the baby, all laughter and dimples,
into the delighted father's arms.</p>

<p>True to her sex, she proceeded to grasp
all he had&mdash;the poker. Steve held on for
safety, but Miss Baby wielded it, and
straightway the fire sent forth a shower of
sparks that went frolicking up the chimney
in pure glee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; said Nannie, pointing to them,
&#8220;look! See how prone to sin you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Steve had no time for his derelictions;
he was busy studying the wonderful
baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this marks an
epoch; and it's Constance's birthday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's your birthday, too, you dear old
stupid!&#8221; laughed Nannie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so it is. I never realized before
that we were twins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never realizes anything about himself,
does he, baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>The baby gave a great assenting dab
at the fire, necessitating a prompt examination
of all her gear to see if she had
caught anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's always thinking of other people
and forgetting himself, isn't he, baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another dab still bigger and another
overlooking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear!&#8221; stammered Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you hush,&#8221; said Nannie imperiously.
&#8220;And he's too foolish and forgetful
of himself to dream that there's
a birthday dinner almost ready in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
dining-room and some be-au-ti-ful things
under somebody's plate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Steve was helplessly and hopelessly
embarrassed, but Nannie snatched
the baby and went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;And he's a regular stupid old know-nothing,
isn't he, baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>And she made the baby give the poker
such a thrust of sympathy that it stuck
fast in the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; she exclaimed, jerking it
out. &#8220;How hot that fire is! I'm fairly
cooked!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a peculiar expression on
Steve's face, and all at once Nannie remembered
a newspaper clipping that had
dropped from one of his note-books that
day when she cleared his desk. A sudden
thought struck her and caused her
to pause with the poker in mid air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been cooking me, sir?&#8221; she
asked in awful tones, taking her seat as a
judge might take his bench.</p>

<p>Steve's color started and a strange
smile dawned upon his face. His very
looks convicted him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it was Nannie who was flushing,
and so prettily, pursing up her bewitching
mouth in the old way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I done?&#8221; she asked presently in a
lower tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;To a turn!&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think I'll get off the spit, by
your leave, sir,&#8221; she said with saucy
bravado.</p>

<p>And she arose to move back from the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steve!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you are <i>devouring</i>
me!&#8221;</p>


<p class="center" style="padding-top: 2em; font-size: 90%">THE END.</p>
